1
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,153
Okay, welcome back everybody.

2
00:02:17,153 --> 00:02:24,161
Good to see you, good to see you.

3
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:29,527
I hope you had a nice weekend.

4
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:39,398
We're gonna go ahead and get started by reviewing the

5
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:43,502
lab exam scores or the average or the histogram.

6
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:51,959
So for the Monday group and tonight and obviously tomorrow,

7
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,883
you'll be able to see your lab exam scores.

8
00:02:56,924 --> 00:03:03,390
Please take a look at those scores for your written as well as the multiple choice.

9
00:03:04,471 --> 00:03:06,673
If you have any questions, ask your TA.

10
00:03:06,673 --> 00:03:09,336
If you feel like you would like to meet with me as

11
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:12,679
well on those lab exams, I'm more than happy to do that as well.

12
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:15,967
So here's the averages.

13
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:20,714
And I think you already know my feeling on how to explain some of these things.

14
00:03:20,714 --> 00:03:28,444
But if you did relatively well, I wouldn't think that it was too easy of an exam.

15
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:30,948
So there were several people who got hundreds or a

16
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,295
handful of individuals, quite a few people who were in the high 90s as well.

17
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:38,098
So if you did well, great.

18
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:44,165
But don't think it was too easy because there were individuals who definitely

19
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:47,890
maybe didn't get as high of a score, and then same with the individuals who are down here.

20
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:51,294
So yeah, it was a difficult exam, but just know

21
00:03:51,294 --> 00:03:55,479
that it wasn't impossible because there were people who still did quite well.

22
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:02,648
So again, if you are down over here, I would hope that you reach out to me sooner rather

23
00:04:02,648 --> 00:04:07,434
than later so we can try and make some adjustments

24
00:04:07,434 --> 00:04:12,180
or make some strategies to help finish strong for the rest of the semester.

25
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:23,751
So on that note, next week, we do have your second lecture exam on March 20th.

26
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:26,275
It will be from chapters eight through 11.

27
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:35,470
So if you remember last week, I had moved chapters 13, 14, and 20 to the final exam.

28
00:04:36,612 --> 00:04:39,417
And then we're just working through eight through 11.

29
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:41,340
So we should be able to get through

30
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,844
the majority if not all of the material by Thursday.

31
00:04:45,844 --> 00:04:53,215
On Tuesday we'll start the chapters 13, but that won't be part of your second exam.

32
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:56,740
So you'll have plenty of time to kind of prepare for the second lecture exam.

33
00:04:58,702 --> 00:04:59,984
Any questions on that piece?

34
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:02,508
Yeah.

35
00:05:05,632 --> 00:05:08,185
Yes, that is correct, yeah, yeah.

36
00:05:08,185 --> 00:05:12,790
So we'll start the next set of slides will be the physiology of training.

37
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:17,375
And I will post those closer to Thursday.

38
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,945
If you haven't heard from me and you have some

39
00:05:26,945 --> 00:05:33,231
sort of accommodation with exams, I would probably come up to

40
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:37,565
me after class and just check in with me really quick.

41
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:41,018
Because, yeah, if you haven't heard from me, I think it

42
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:44,932
would be good to just check in with me really quick to make sure we're on track.

43
00:05:44,932 --> 00:05:46,478
So, okay.

44
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,783
I'm also holding quite a few office hours this week.

45
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:56,951
I'll post some office hours next week, but I will say this Friday section

46
00:05:56,951 --> 00:06:01,336
or this Friday time slot from 12.30 to 2.30 in

47
00:06:01,336 --> 00:06:04,660
Claire 111 and those back tables, that's pretty much I'm gonna be

48
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,425
there for the rest of the semester, so I know that slot is gonna be open.

49
00:06:08,425 --> 00:06:11,409
But again, I'll try to sprinkle in some hours every now

50
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:13,812
and then, especially as we get closer to exams.

51
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:16,476
But this will be my permanent hours, and I've updated

52
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,200
that on the Canvas website, especially on that grid.

53
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,767
So if you ever want to look for my office hours, I'll be on here.

54
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:27,814
But I'll have some hours tomorrow as well as Thursday morning.

55
00:06:27,814 --> 00:06:31,579
So if you would like to meet then, talk about

56
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:36,247
the upcoming material or the current material that we're in

57
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:40,393
for lecture exam two, I would highly recommend that.

58
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:48,194
OK, any questions on this stuff?

59
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:50,076
Nice.

60
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,280
OK, so we're going to finish respiration during exercise,

61
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,805
and then we'll move on to acid-base balance for chapter 11.

62
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:03,974
But on Thursday, we left off this concept on the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve.

63
00:07:04,915 --> 00:07:09,621
Some of the big pieces here would be this is indicating

64
00:07:11,677 --> 00:07:18,768
this arterial partial pressure of oxygen, and by default, meaning what we kind of know

65
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:21,934
for the partial pressure, or maybe the partial pressure of

66
00:07:21,934 --> 00:07:28,724
oxygen in the blood, we kind of know where or what location we're talking about inside of the body.

67
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:33,432
So if we're looking at a partial pressure around 100,

68
00:07:34,306 --> 00:07:37,129
Well, we know that's closer to the lungs and it's

69
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:41,514
arterial PO2 because that's when the red blood cells or the

70
00:07:41,514 --> 00:07:44,518
hemoglobin molecules are doing the most of the oxygen loading.

71
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:49,003
And we know down by 40, well, this is a partial

72
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:52,988
pressure closer to what we would experience at rest.

73
00:07:52,988 --> 00:07:56,872
And so this is kind of that mixed venous tissue partial pressure.

74
00:07:56,872 --> 00:08:04,161
And so typically this location is first changing from 100 to 40 closer to the tissues.

75
00:08:05,947 --> 00:08:10,774
The flat portion is really important or the sigmoidal curve is really important

76
00:08:10,774 --> 00:08:14,900
because the flat portion helps defend against large changes

77
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:21,269
in pressure, meaning we only get small changes in saturation.

78
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:24,835
The steep portion is kind of flipped around.

79
00:08:24,835 --> 00:08:28,880
We wanna encourage offloading of oxygen to the tissues.

80
00:08:29,862 --> 00:08:34,789
So small changes in pressure, pressure results in large changes in saturation.

81
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:43,962
We then can look at kind of the difference or from the loading to the offloading.

82
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:48,627
So from this portion to this portion, we can kind of look

83
00:08:48,627 --> 00:08:56,115
at how much O2 was delivered or the O2 content to the blood would give us this AVO2 difference over here.

84
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:02,798
I know I just,

85
00:09:02,798 --> 00:09:12,616
reviewed it, but does anyone have any general questions about this graph?

86
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:12,676
OK.

87
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:15,881
So this is kind of base, right?

88
00:09:15,881 --> 00:09:16,763
This is standard.

89
00:09:16,763 --> 00:09:21,411
At rest, we're expecting, in general, like a pH of 7.4.

90
00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:25,639
And our core body temperature is around 37 degrees Celsius.

91
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:26,781
And this is how

92
00:09:28,837 --> 00:09:32,942
For most individuals, this is how everyone's graph or

93
00:09:32,942 --> 00:09:34,984
hemoglobin dissociation curve is going to look.

94
00:09:34,984 --> 00:09:36,606
Obviously, there's going to be some differences.

95
00:09:36,606 --> 00:09:41,291
We'll talk about some, especially some genetic differences that might change this curve.

96
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:45,436
But in general, we can kind of say this is what we'd experience at rest.

97
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:51,343
But there are certain factors, specifically three factors,

98
00:09:52,264 --> 00:09:56,869
that can modulate this oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve.

99
00:09:57,777 --> 00:09:59,279
The first one will be pH.

100
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:03,345
So if you increase the acidity or increase the

101
00:10:03,345 --> 00:10:07,590
hydrogen ion concentration, it will decrease the pH.

102
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:15,121
If you decrease the pH, it lowers or reduces the affinity of oxygen to the hemoglobin molecules.

103
00:10:17,905 --> 00:10:22,110
If it reduces the affinity, it favors offloading.

104
00:10:23,472 --> 00:10:26,957
So it's easier for the oxygen molecules to kind of

105
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,242
leave the hemoglobin.

106
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:36,294
It also kind of makes it a little bit hard for

107
00:10:36,294 --> 00:10:41,903
loading, but not in the magnitude that we would expect because of the flat portion.

108
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:44,126
And we'll take a look at that in just a second.

109
00:10:45,088 --> 00:10:50,116
But any time you are changing the hemoglobin oxygen dissociation

110
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,540
curve due to pH, we call that the Bohr effect.

111
00:10:53,465 --> 00:10:56,969
That's from the researcher who developed or discovered

112
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:06,781
this change in oxygen affinity to hemoglobin with pH.

113
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:07,942
OK, no surprise.

114
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:13,769
During intense exercise, there's an increase in the hydrogen

115
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:19,351
ion concentration, which is going to decrease the pH or make the blood a little bit more acidic.

116
00:11:19,351 --> 00:11:22,134
And so that's going to be this curve here.

117
00:11:22,134 --> 00:11:30,343
So the middle curve that we're looking at is the normal curve during rest or at normal pH levels.

118
00:11:30,343 --> 00:11:32,565
And if we have a decrease in this pH or an

119
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:36,689
increase in acidity, then we're going to shift the curve to the right.

120
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:39,973
If it becomes more basic or an increase in pH, it's going

121
00:11:39,973 --> 00:11:41,614
to shift the curve a little bit to the left.

122
00:11:44,798 --> 00:11:47,080
The hydrogen ions or the acidity

123
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:54,421
is kind of interfering or binding or causing the ability

124
00:11:54,421 --> 00:11:57,567
for the hemoglobin molecules to bind to the oxygen to reduce.

125
00:11:58,408 --> 00:12:04,258
So the hydrogen ions are reducing the hemoglobin's ability to transport O2.

126
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:09,797
A nice way to look at what kind of happens

127
00:12:09,797 --> 00:12:15,506
with shifts in your hemoglobin dissociation curve would be to just

128
00:12:15,506 --> 00:12:18,691
pick one of these points that we've been talking about.

129
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:24,320
So at 40, at rest, if I all of a sudden was

130
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,368
kind of experiencing some type of decrease in pH or acidity, then at

131
00:12:29,368 --> 00:12:32,693
40, all I'm going to do is just draw a line up

132
00:12:34,782 --> 00:12:37,485
and it looks like I'm around 60% saturation.

133
00:12:38,446 --> 00:12:44,573
Compared to, if I keep going up, well maybe 75% saturation at rest.

134
00:12:44,573 --> 00:12:48,117
So you saw that there was a decrease in the saturation

135
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:51,220
with an increase in acidity or decrease in pH.

136
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,424
And then same if we go all the way up.

137
00:12:54,424 --> 00:12:56,687
So if I start at 40 and I'm working my way up

138
00:12:56,687 --> 00:13:01,532
here and then I get to this more basic concentration here, it's around 85.

139
00:13:06,423 --> 00:13:09,747
And then you can do the same for a given saturation.

140
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:14,773
So at 50% saturation, what is the partial pressure needed to achieve that saturation?

141
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:18,037
So you can go from the y-axis over and then drop lines down.

142
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:33,055
Another factor or an effect on the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve would be temperature.

143
00:13:35,245 --> 00:13:38,970
If you have an increase in blood temperature, that also

144
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:43,656
lowers the affinity of oxygen to the hemoglobin molecule, which

145
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,479
then would also shift the curve to the right.

146
00:13:50,685 --> 00:13:54,790
As expected during exercise, we have an increase in core body temperature.

147
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,313
The increase in temperature weakens the bond between

148
00:13:59,313 --> 00:14:03,358
the oxygen and the hemoglobin molecules, which then assists in

149
00:14:03,358 --> 00:14:06,862
the unloading of oxygen to the working tissues.

150
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:07,703
Same deal, right?

151
00:14:07,703 --> 00:14:13,130
Like 37 degrees is this middle graph or the middle sigmoidal curve.

152
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,111
I'll just take one point.

153
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:15,833
You can do any point on here.

154
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,495
Just draw a line up.

155
00:14:17,495 --> 00:14:19,538
As soon as you hit one of the graphs, move it

156
00:14:19,538 --> 00:14:22,161
over to the y-axis and see what happened to saturation.

157
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:30,599
So as we mentioned, the interesting thing or the nice

158
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:37,532
thing about the sigmoidal curve, on the steep portion, we're getting these large changes in saturation.

159
00:14:38,755 --> 00:14:40,872
But on the flat portion,

160
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:44,456
At 100, this is a very minor change.

161
00:14:44,456 --> 00:14:47,640
And so even 32, if you started drawing this line all

162
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,244
the way over, we're seeing deltas of like two or

163
00:14:51,244 --> 00:14:57,090
three percentage point differences between those different curves.

164
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,274
So very small changes here, but very large changes here.

165
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,758
Although I will mention 42 degrees is a little extreme.

166
00:15:10,758 --> 00:15:14,083
So hyperthermia is around 40 degrees C. So we typically would

167
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:19,049
not see this a whole lot in vivo, in the human.

168
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:21,433
A lot of this is done in a Petri dish where they heat it up.

169
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:23,856
But you can kind of see how the curve still shifts.

170
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:28,803
Any questions on temperature?

171
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:37,575
OK, the last one is 2,3-DPG, diphosphoglycerate.

172
00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:44,446
Sometimes it's BPG as well as bifospho, so DPG, BPG.

173
00:15:44,446 --> 00:15:47,952
It's a byproduct of red blood cell glycolysis.

174
00:15:47,952 --> 00:15:50,516
So there are no mitochondria inside the red blood cells.

175
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:54,523
So they need to undergo glycolysis to produce energy.

176
00:15:54,523 --> 00:15:57,648
And one of those byproducts is 2,3-DPG.

177
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:04,980
2,3-DPG also causes a rightward shift of the curve.

178
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,900
Here's one thing to note, though.

179
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:13,948
It's not a major cause of the rightward shift during exercise at sea level.

180
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:25,686
We just don't produce enough of this at sea level, especially during exercise.

181
00:16:27,607 --> 00:16:32,133
during both acute exposure to high altitude in rest and

182
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:38,101
ice, we do see a relatively large increase in this 2,3-DPG.

183
00:16:38,101 --> 00:16:41,606
So when we get to altitude, the altitude chapters will

184
00:16:41,606 --> 00:16:45,912
briefly touch on how this kind of shifts the hemoglobin dissociation curve.

185
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:50,962
But,

186
00:16:50,962 --> 00:16:54,588
Regardless, this does increase with exercise.

187
00:16:55,469 --> 00:16:57,492
So the one thing that we've kind of picked up where I

188
00:16:57,492 --> 00:17:00,717
guess, yeah, the one thing that we picked up for all

189
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:07,728
of these three things, what direction are they changing with exercise?

190
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,194
Say again?

191
00:17:12,194 --> 00:17:15,940
Yeah, everything's shifting to the right because all of these things are maybe like

192
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:20,460
pH is a tricky one, it's not really increasing,

193
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:27,010
but you're increasing the acidity, you're increasing the temperature, and you're increasing 2,3-BPG.

194
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,995
All of those should make sense to you when you exercise.

195
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:35,323
Your body gets warmer when you exercise, it becomes a little bit more acidic due to exercise,

196
00:17:35,323 --> 00:17:38,388
and you're kind of undergoing glycolysis a little bit more,

197
00:17:38,388 --> 00:17:40,851
but again, that's more inside of the red blood cell,

198
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:45,859
but still, all of those are increasing during exercise, so you can just think,

199
00:17:46,835 --> 00:17:52,742
During exercise, there's a rightward shift to the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve.

200
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:58,448
You don't need to worry about which one's more, which one's less, except for maybe this one.

201
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:02,032
This is not a major cause of a rightward shift

202
00:18:02,032 --> 00:18:05,115
during exercise at sea level, but during altitude it is.

203
00:18:05,115 --> 00:18:08,099
But regardless, they all shift the curve to the right.

204
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:13,525
So even if you forget, oh, man, what happened to temperature?

205
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,607
Does it shift it left, or does it shift it right?

206
00:18:15,607 --> 00:18:17,711
Just think about what happens during exercise, and

207
00:18:17,711 --> 00:18:19,995
anything that happens during exercise, it shifts it to the right.

208
00:18:23,962 --> 00:18:27,288
And then reverse is to the left, right?

209
00:18:27,288 --> 00:18:31,115
Cold, basic, less two, three DPGs to the left.

210
00:18:36,806 --> 00:18:36,906
Okay.

211
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:44,590
So yeah, this is the normal curve on here.

212
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,197
Oh, sorry, the dotted line here is the normal curve.

213
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:54,609
All of those three things that we talked about shifts it to the right.

214
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:56,572
So it shifts this curve to the right.

215
00:18:57,454 --> 00:19:02,303
And the nice thing about that is now we're encouraging and offloading

216
00:19:03,548 --> 00:19:09,859
of the oxygen and molecules, so we get a larger AVO2 difference compared to at rest.

217
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:18,393
So this line or this arrow right here is indicating the AVO2 difference at rest,

218
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:21,478
and then now this line right here is indicating the

219
00:19:21,478 --> 00:19:25,024
AVO2 difference at exercise, and that's due to a shift

220
00:19:25,024 --> 00:19:28,189
in the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right.

221
00:19:31,814 --> 00:19:35,258
Yeah, so it's just we're able to deliver more oxygen to the tissues.

222
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,100
Yeah, yeah, no, that's a good question.

223
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:51,536
Okay.

224
00:19:51,536 --> 00:19:52,617
Any other questions on this?

225
00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:00,606
All right, that means you are so ready for this clicker question.

226
00:20:06,374 --> 00:20:09,328
What is the result of a rightward shift in

227
00:20:09,328 --> 00:20:12,223
the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve during exercise?

228
00:20:13,388 --> 00:20:13,971
Oh man.

229
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:42,852
Okay, let's get something in here.

230
00:21:49,781 --> 00:21:51,984
I'll close this down in 15 seconds.

231
00:21:54,107 --> 00:21:56,049
Does anyone need more time getting their clicker set up?

232
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:02,578
Okay, about five seconds.

233
00:22:04,313 --> 00:22:07,139
Three, two, one.

234
00:22:10,405 --> 00:22:11,347
Okay, how did we do?

235
00:22:11,347 --> 00:22:16,677
Nice job, nice job.

236
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:19,082
This is the correct answer.

237
00:22:27,483 --> 00:22:30,708
oxygen on unloading becomes easier at the muscles, right?

238
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,892
We wanna be able to deliver more oxygen to the

239
00:22:32,892 --> 00:22:40,565
tissues because during exercise, there's a larger decrease or demand in oxygen.

240
00:22:40,565 --> 00:22:42,928
So there's a decrease in that pressure of oxygen.

241
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:49,179
So we wanna deliver more oxygen to create energy for exercise.

242
00:22:52,124 --> 00:22:54,267
Any questions on this clicker question?

243
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:03,390
You've probably noticed that some of these clicker questions,

244
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:09,021
at least in these last past slide decks for the second

245
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:14,292
unit, hopefully they're looking more familiar to an exam question.

246
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,537
They're worded, in my opinion, a little bit more familiar.

247
00:23:16,537 --> 00:23:21,587
But this one was really, well, I don't want to say easy, but it was a little more straightforward.

248
00:23:22,394 --> 00:23:25,718
Okay, changes in arterial venous O2 content during exercise.

249
00:23:25,718 --> 00:23:29,603
We've already touched on this, that as you increase

250
00:23:29,603 --> 00:23:33,547
in intensity, there's a larger AVO2 difference, and that's

251
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:39,735
because, again, cellular respiration at the muscles, that is increasing,

252
00:23:39,735 --> 00:23:42,298
so we wanna be able to deliver more oxygen.

253
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:46,363
So no surprise that the AVO2 difference is greater.

254
00:23:46,363 --> 00:23:48,385
So we've already seen this slide here.

255
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:55,527
But one of the things we kind of not skipped over, but saved for now would be,

256
00:23:55,527 --> 00:23:59,693
okay, well, if the hemoglobin molecules are now delivering

257
00:23:59,693 --> 00:24:05,641
the oxygen, the oxygen has to now diffuse across the membrane and then find its way to the muscle.

258
00:24:06,943 --> 00:24:14,234
Well, oxygen doesn't really diffuse in liquid very well, so it needs some sort of carrier.

259
00:24:14,234 --> 00:24:16,397
And so in the blood we have hemoglobin,

260
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:21,580
In the muscles we have myoglobin, or in the tissues for the muscles.

261
00:24:22,642 --> 00:24:25,907
So here you have your capillary, you have your endothelium,

262
00:24:25,907 --> 00:24:28,291
and then we have the myoglobin that are kind of over here

263
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:33,600
capturing the oxygen, so then we can deliver it to the mitochondria.

264
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,105
So myoglobin helps shuttle the oxygen from the cell

265
00:24:37,105 --> 00:24:41,693
membrane to the mitochondria of the skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers.

266
00:24:48,068 --> 00:24:49,911
One thing to keep in mind, and we'll see a

267
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:53,156
different curve here, but the partial pressure of oxygen

268
00:24:53,156 --> 00:24:58,564
in the mitochondria for contracting skeletal muscle, that can get all

269
00:24:58,564 --> 00:25:03,190
the way down to like one or two, as far as the partial pressure of oxygen.

270
00:25:04,532 --> 00:25:06,255
So it's getting way down there.

271
00:25:07,317 --> 00:25:10,181
Even though our mixed venous blood is around 40,

272
00:25:11,182 --> 00:25:15,088
while the mitochondria are experiencing some pretty low partial pressures of oxygen.

273
00:25:18,055 --> 00:25:24,044
Okay, myoglobin content is high in type I fibers and lower

274
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:29,091
in type IIX fibers and then a moderate amount or in between for those type IIA fibers.

275
00:25:30,013 --> 00:25:31,214
And this should make sense, right?

276
00:25:31,214 --> 00:25:33,999
Like we have a higher density of myoglobin and

277
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:38,325
the ones that are undergoing oxidative phosphorylation at the highest rate.

278
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:47,192
The only way this transport system works is if myoglobin

279
00:25:47,192 --> 00:25:51,858
has a higher affinity for oxygen than hemoglobin.

280
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:59,249
In particular, it can bind to oxygen at very low partial pressures.

281
00:26:02,053 --> 00:26:08,262
So if that's the case, then myoglobin has its own oxygen dissociation curve.

282
00:26:09,271 --> 00:26:12,354
This one is not very sigmoidal.

283
00:26:14,377 --> 00:26:19,262
Mono-exponential, you could probably call this, but here you still

284
00:26:19,262 --> 00:26:24,467
see a steep portion and a flat portion.

285
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:28,071
The one thing to note would be that the flat portion

286
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:37,101
or the flatter portion for the myoglobin are over the steep portion of the hemoglobin.

287
00:26:39,578 --> 00:26:46,786
so that when the hemoglobin are offloading oxygen, that

288
00:26:46,786 --> 00:26:50,631
is the partial pressure where myoglobin is loading.

289
00:26:53,114 --> 00:26:56,378
So again, saturation with oxygen is on the y-axis, the

290
00:26:56,378 --> 00:27:01,178
partial pressure of oxygen is on the x here, the blue,

291
00:27:01,178 --> 00:27:04,883
is myoglobin and the red is hemoglobin.

292
00:27:04,883 --> 00:27:07,667
So this would be the unloading portion or the steep

293
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:15,038
portion here for the hemoglobin and then the flatter loading portion for the hemoglobin on this side.

294
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:21,748
So when the hemoglobin molecules are unloading, they are offloading to the myoglobin

295
00:27:21,748 --> 00:27:25,413
and then the myoglobin, their steep portion is more

296
00:27:25,413 --> 00:27:30,035
closely associated with the partial pressures that we experience in the mitochondria.

297
00:27:30,035 --> 00:27:35,343
That way the myoglobin can easily release oxygen to

298
00:27:35,343 --> 00:27:39,328
the tissues, or particularly the mitochondria, at these lower partial pressures.

299
00:27:50,404 --> 00:27:50,525
Yeah.

300
00:27:50,525 --> 00:27:52,287
Why is the hemoglobin curve still increasing its oxygen?

301
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:52,568
It's unloaded.

302
00:27:57,334 --> 00:27:57,815
Say that one more time.

303
00:27:57,815 --> 00:27:57,975
So why?

304
00:27:57,975 --> 00:27:59,097
Why is the hemoglobin curve still increasing its oxygen?

305
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:08,786
Yeah, maybe I'm still not quite understanding that, but you

306
00:28:08,786 --> 00:28:11,095
could almost think of it going from right to left.

307
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:13,599
Does that help a little bit?

308
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:16,562
So like over here, we're in the arterial blood.

309
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:22,648
And then when we get to the venous blood, this piece here, the steeper portion is offloading.

310
00:28:22,648 --> 00:28:27,252
And so the hemoglobin themselves are decreasing in saturation here.

311
00:28:27,252 --> 00:28:30,935
And then you can almost think of it as the saturation

312
00:28:30,935 --> 00:28:38,242
on the myoglobin are remaining high or going back to high or picking up the oxygen here.

313
00:28:38,242 --> 00:28:39,023
And then,

314
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:44,312
This location, this region right here, if I were to

315
00:28:44,312 --> 00:28:47,196
put another dotted line, I could put another dotted line

316
00:28:47,196 --> 00:28:50,641
right here and say like mitochondria partial pressure.

317
00:28:53,344 --> 00:28:54,826
Does that help a little bit?

318
00:28:54,826 --> 00:28:54,926
Okay.

319
00:29:01,434 --> 00:29:04,278
Any questions on this curve or these curves?

320
00:29:07,022 --> 00:29:08,824
Okay, let's get some practice here.

321
00:29:13,883 --> 00:29:17,141
When the partial pressure of oxygen is approximately 25

322
00:29:17,141 --> 00:29:21,987
millimeters of mercury, what are myoglobin and hemoglobin doing respectively?

323
00:30:05,032 --> 00:30:06,296
Go about a minute longer.

324
00:30:06,296 --> 00:30:08,885
Feel free to chat with your classmates.

325
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,641
Convince them otherwise or support their.

326
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:07,820
Okay, we'll go maybe 15 seconds from now, unless someone needs a little more time than that.

327
00:31:15,913 --> 00:31:17,475
Okay, I'll close it down in five seconds.

328
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,639
I think we have everybody in.

329
00:31:23,078 --> 00:31:25,966
All right, three, two, one.

330
00:31:32,844 --> 00:31:33,887
Okay, nice.

331
00:31:33,887 --> 00:31:34,508
Nice job.

332
00:31:36,834 --> 00:31:37,476
It is C.

333
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:42,461
So here's my pointer down here.

334
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:48,650
If we are looking closer to this 20, 25, so maybe 25

335
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:52,836
is just barely over here because 30 is over here, so maybe 25 is here.

336
00:31:52,836 --> 00:31:53,698
I bring it up.

337
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:02,971
If saturation of the hemoglobin molecules are at 25 and

338
00:32:02,971 --> 00:32:09,100
they just came from the lungs at around 100, what has just happened

339
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,473
I guess, yeah, what has just happened?

340
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,019
I mean, it says it on there, but.

341
00:32:21,322 --> 00:32:23,845
So we're at the lungs and the arterial blood.

342
00:32:25,607 --> 00:32:27,529
The oxygen gets pumped to the muscle.

343
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:33,596
And then down over here, the oxygen, is it still on the hemoglobin molecules?

344
00:32:34,717 --> 00:32:37,582
No, yeah, so it gets released.

345
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:40,865
So it's basically at this point in time unloading.

346
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:47,072
And then the myoglobin are picking up the oxygen.

347
00:32:47,072 --> 00:32:48,253
So those are the ones loading.

348
00:32:49,895 --> 00:32:55,641
So if we're looking at myoglobin at this partial pressure here, we're seeing that it is loading.

349
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:58,724
So that's loading over here.

350
00:32:58,724 --> 00:33:00,626
And then the hemoglobin molecules are unloading.

351
00:33:05,491 --> 00:33:06,492
Questions on this?

352
00:33:09,104 --> 00:33:09,413
Okay.

353
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:15,450
One thing to note, too, since we touched on this

354
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:21,977
before, oxygen deficit and EPOC, the myoglobin O2 store serve as an O2 reserve.

355
00:33:21,977 --> 00:33:26,402
So even at rest, we have kind of all the

356
00:33:26,402 --> 00:33:31,308
myoglobin molecules 100% saturated or close to 100% saturated.

357
00:33:31,308 --> 00:33:34,331
And so they help kind of deliver some of

358
00:33:34,331 --> 00:33:40,478
that oxygen relatively quickly during the transitory period from rest to exercise.

359
00:33:42,635 --> 00:33:48,502
After exercise, if you remember those five factors that were contributing to EPOC,

360
00:33:48,502 --> 00:33:52,367
well, we need to replenish those oxygen stores, and so

361
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:59,577
we kind of have that elevated oxygen consumption after exercise, or EPOC.

362
00:34:05,704 --> 00:34:06,325
We okay here?

363
00:34:08,368 --> 00:34:10,495
Nice, all right.

364
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:12,657
Okay, CO2 transport in the blood.

365
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:18,223
So now we're still over here, but now we're talking about CO2, almost on this side of things.

366
00:34:23,588 --> 00:34:28,713
Carbon dioxide is a little bit different than oxygen in the

367
00:34:28,713 --> 00:34:36,550
fact that it can dissolve a lot better into fluid or liquids like water compared to oxygen.

368
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,753
Because of that, we actually do get a relatively

369
00:34:39,753 --> 00:34:43,397
substantial amount of CO2 that dissolves into plasma.

370
00:34:44,378 --> 00:34:46,561
In particular, approximately 10%.

371
00:34:46,561 --> 00:34:52,547
This is a relatively wide range, especially as we shift

372
00:34:52,547 --> 00:34:54,830
on this curve, which we'll talk about in just a little bit.

373
00:34:55,931 --> 00:34:59,915
But we can get a lot of CO2 dissolved into the plasma.

374
00:34:59,915 --> 00:35:06,031
On average, at rest, maybe 10% is dissolved into the plasma.

375
00:35:06,031 --> 00:35:08,697
We can get a little bit bound to hemoglobin.

376
00:35:09,979 --> 00:35:19,720
The rest travels inside of the blood as bicarbonate.

377
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:25,209
We're gonna go through this curve or at least this kind of reaction a couple times.

378
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:28,754
The one thing to note, it goes both ways, right?

379
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:33,982
So if I have carbon dioxide, it combines relatively

380
00:35:33,982 --> 00:35:37,868
quickly or dissociates relatively quickly into carbonic acid.

381
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:44,298
We typically don't like carbonic acid in fluids.

382
00:35:44,298 --> 00:35:47,823
And so just like lactic acid, it dissociates into

383
00:35:47,823 --> 00:35:50,567
bicarbonate and a hydrogen ion relatively quickly.

384
00:35:51,728 --> 00:35:58,116
So if we have high concentrations of CO2, it generally pushes the curve towards the right.

385
00:35:59,037 --> 00:36:02,621
And then if we have higher concentrations of hydrogens,

386
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:05,124
they generally push the curve towards the left.

387
00:36:10,611 --> 00:36:14,780
And you may have remembered the bicarb buffering system here.

388
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,887
pairs relatively well with the chloride shift.

389
00:36:17,887 --> 00:36:19,410
So we have an increase.

390
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,154
So this is at the tissues.

391
00:36:21,154 --> 00:36:22,717
So we're looking at the tissues here.

392
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:28,670
We have an increase in CO2 production from cellular metabolism.

393
00:36:29,472 --> 00:36:34,912
We then have some of that CO2 dissolve into the plasma.

394
00:36:34,912 --> 00:36:38,838
Some of it binds with hemoglobin, as we mentioned before.

395
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:42,163
The rest undergoes that bicarb buffering, and then we

396
00:36:42,163 --> 00:36:46,269
have that chloride shift where a chloride comes in and the bicarb comes out.

397
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:54,422
Then the blood moves through the systemic circuit, reaches

398
00:36:54,422 --> 00:36:58,708
the pulmonary circuit to the lungs, so we can then exhale.

399
00:36:59,971 --> 00:37:01,493
a carbon dioxide.

400
00:37:01,493 --> 00:37:06,842
So then we have the chloride shift again that converts your bicarb back to CO2.

401
00:37:07,744 --> 00:37:12,792
The CO2 also kind of unbinds from the hemoglobin as well

402
00:37:12,792 --> 00:37:19,262
as the dissolved CO2 in the plasma are encouraged to enter the alveoli so then we can exhale.

403
00:37:27,055 --> 00:37:31,620
What do we think is the cause that is allowing for

404
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:40,811
this shift of CO2 in the direction that favors us at the tissues and the lungs?

405
00:37:40,811 --> 00:37:42,453
What's encouraging that?

406
00:37:42,453 --> 00:37:43,734
What's the only way this can happen?

407
00:37:45,877 --> 00:37:46,137
Say again?

408
00:37:46,978 --> 00:37:48,439
Yeah, the partial pressure.

409
00:37:48,439 --> 00:37:53,380
The partial pressure of CO2 is extremely, not extremely, but it's very high.

410
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:58,086
at the tissues, especially the muscles, because again, they're undergoing cellular respiration.

411
00:37:58,086 --> 00:38:01,270
So there's this high concentration of CO2 in the mitochondria.

412
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,232
It gets pushed out into the blood.

413
00:38:03,232 --> 00:38:07,418
And so naturally, it's going to favor this type of reaction.

414
00:38:09,741 --> 00:38:14,306
Anyone remember what the partial pressure of CO2 is in the air, in the environment?

415
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:22,675
Yeah, I think I heard someone say it, but 0.03%, so 0.000.

416
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,099
I think I added one more.

417
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:30,789
But it's a very, very small fraction of CO2 inside

418
00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:35,618
of the alveoli, because we're breathing that low concentration of CO2 in.

419
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:43,311
Well, we're sending a high concentration or a higher partial pressure of CO2 to the lungs.

420
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:46,236
And so naturally, it's going to want to diffuse into the alveoli.

421
00:38:53,472 --> 00:38:54,073
Are you okay there?

422
00:38:56,596 --> 00:38:56,816
All right.

423
00:38:56,816 --> 00:38:59,659
So then that should make this next part relatively straightforward.

424
00:38:59,659 --> 00:39:04,865
The pulmonary ventilation removes hydrogen from the blood by the bicarb reaction.

425
00:39:06,367 --> 00:39:12,254
So it's gonna encourage the movement towards CO2 so we can exhale that out.

426
00:39:15,097 --> 00:39:17,860
So the lung is gonna move it towards this way.

427
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:22,518
The muscle goes the other way because we have a

428
00:39:22,518 --> 00:39:26,062
higher concentration of CO2 in the muscle compared to the blood.

429
00:39:30,687 --> 00:39:35,472
If you increase ventilation, then we are increasing the amount

430
00:39:35,472 --> 00:39:39,456
of CO2 that we are exhaling into the environment.

431
00:39:39,456 --> 00:39:45,923
This helps reduce the partial pressure of CO2 as well as reduce the hydrogen concentration.

432
00:39:51,404 --> 00:39:55,210
If you reduce the hydrogen concentration, pH increases.

433
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:06,467
If you decrease, yeah.

434
00:40:06,467 --> 00:40:08,029
So this counteracts the hydrogen ion increase you were talking about earlier?

435
00:40:08,029 --> 00:40:08,830
Yes.

436
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:09,892
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

437
00:40:12,696 --> 00:40:19,707
So this helps us deal with this large increase in hydrogen ion concentration or this drop in pH.

438
00:40:21,965 --> 00:40:25,029
and you all have probably felt this before if you hold your breath, but

439
00:40:25,029 --> 00:40:29,435
if you decrease ventilation, this then causes a buildup

440
00:40:29,435 --> 00:40:33,980
of CO2, increases the pressure pressure of CO2, as well

441
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:39,247
as increases the number of hydrogen ions, which then decreases the pH.

442
00:40:46,296 --> 00:40:49,260
Okay.

443
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,412
So if you ever

444
00:40:51,412 --> 00:40:54,776
kind of forget about which direction this reaction is going.

445
00:40:54,776 --> 00:40:57,600
Just think about the two locations, lung and the muscle.

446
00:40:58,741 --> 00:41:04,128
What's the partial pressure or what's the percentage of CO2 in the air that we breathe in?

447
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:09,054
What's the percentage of CO2 at the mitochondria

448
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:15,242
when we're living because it's undergoing cellular respiration, so it's producing a lot of CO2?

449
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:20,479
And that should help determine which way this reaction

450
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:25,865
drives, either over towards bicarb or over towards CO2.

451
00:41:33,514 --> 00:41:35,676
Okay, so then we're gonna move on to this next

452
00:41:35,676 --> 00:41:39,340
question of does the pulmonary system limit exercise performance?

453
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,433
Before we answer that question, we're gonna do a

454
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:45,997
little bit of background about changes in ventilation and

455
00:41:45,997 --> 00:41:50,042
arterial gases during the transition from rest to moderate exercise.

456
00:41:51,103 --> 00:41:59,111
So if we have submaximal exercise where steady state is achieved, so if we're looking here,

457
00:41:59,111 --> 00:42:02,615
we have submaximal exercise for six minutes, and we

458
00:42:02,615 --> 00:42:08,061
have ventilation PCO2 and PO2, partial pressure of O2 and partial pressure of CO2.

459
00:42:10,032 --> 00:42:15,782
During this transition, we then reach steady state of ventilation.

460
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:19,408
And we can see that the partial pressure of oxygen

461
00:42:19,408 --> 00:42:26,380
and the partial pressure of CO2 are stable throughout steady state for submaximal exercise.

462
00:42:33,111 --> 00:42:33,171
OK.

463
00:42:35,142 --> 00:42:38,146
One little caveat that I'll put to this is if

464
00:42:38,146 --> 00:42:41,231
we have this submaximal exercise and we're achieving steady state

465
00:42:41,231 --> 00:42:46,378
with ventilation and I heat up the room, what do you think will happen?

466
00:42:50,384 --> 00:42:50,885
Any ideas?

467
00:42:53,308 --> 00:42:56,733
If you heat up the room, do you think it'll get easier or harder to do the exercise?

468
00:42:58,255 --> 00:42:59,777
Harder, yeah.

469
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:02,922
And so we typically would see this kind of drift

470
00:43:05,247 --> 00:43:10,754
So same kind of graph, but we have exercise duration for 50 minutes.

471
00:43:11,575 --> 00:43:14,398
The blue line is for cool environment.

472
00:43:14,398 --> 00:43:16,260
The red line is for a hot environment.

473
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,503
And we have ventilation and partial pressure of CO2.

474
00:43:21,126 --> 00:43:27,614
The interesting thing here, if I have ventilation not

475
00:43:27,614 --> 00:43:31,879
changing in a cool environment, then it increases

476
00:43:34,677 --> 00:43:43,485
in a hot environment, what would we expect to see as far as the exhalation of CO2?

477
00:43:43,485 --> 00:43:45,246
Should we generate increase?

478
00:43:46,548 --> 00:43:49,670
Yeah, that's what I would expect too based on what we just talked about.

479
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:53,334
If you increase ventilation, you're exhaling more CO2 molecules.

480
00:43:53,334 --> 00:43:54,295
But look at the top graph.

481
00:43:55,516 --> 00:44:02,642
The partial pressure of CO2 is not different between hot and cool conditions.

482
00:44:04,799 --> 00:44:05,600
Well, that's weird.

483
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,924
How does that happen?

484
00:44:08,924 --> 00:44:10,847
Any thoughts on that?

485
00:44:10,847 --> 00:44:13,070
Only because I mentioned this very briefly last week.

486
00:44:15,032 --> 00:44:18,357
Is there a way we can increase ventilation without

487
00:44:18,357 --> 00:44:21,380
actually changing the concentration of some of these molecules?

488
00:44:26,687 --> 00:44:27,228
No guesses?

489
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:32,930
So if you remember, there's something called an anatomical dead space.

490
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:37,790
And when you hyperventilate, due to increases in temperature,

491
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:42,497
your breathing frequency typically increases, but your tidal volume

492
00:44:42,497 --> 00:44:46,963
starts to either stay the same or get a little bit lower.

493
00:44:46,963 --> 00:44:51,190
So you're actually not taking deeper breaths, you're just increasing the frequency.

494
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,134
And so it's believed that most individuals, unless

495
00:44:54,134 --> 00:44:58,180
you actively think about changing your breathing, if I all heat

496
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:04,489
up, or heat up this room and everyone starts to hyperventilate a little bit, it'll be due mainly

497
00:45:05,701 --> 00:45:10,008
to this exchange of this anatomical dead space which is

498
00:45:10,008 --> 00:45:12,773
not interacting with the alveoli inside of the lungs.

499
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,725
And so it's believed that this increase in ventilation

500
00:45:19,725 --> 00:45:26,477
or this panting or this increase in frequency is just to exhale more heat out.

501
00:45:27,436 --> 00:45:29,880
So I kind of mentioned like certain animals do this

502
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,387
because a lot of animals don't actually sweat like humans.

503
00:45:33,387 --> 00:45:35,811
And so the main way they release heat is to pant.

504
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:46,050
And so again, this is really theorized to be a thermoregulatory behavior.

505
00:45:46,951 --> 00:45:47,993
But it's quite interesting.

506
00:45:52,664 --> 00:45:55,628
Okay, but at a certain point in time with graded exercise,

507
00:45:55,628 --> 00:46:03,519
if we get to a high enough intensity, we see there is a substantial change in the slope of ventilation.

508
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,744
So it doesn't increase linearly across all speeds.

509
00:46:07,885 --> 00:46:12,231
We hit this ventilatory threshold, which is very closely

510
00:46:12,231 --> 00:46:19,021
linked to lactate threshold, and we see this exponential increase in ventilation.

511
00:46:19,021 --> 00:46:22,165
Well, once we get past that, in this area,

512
00:46:24,203 --> 00:46:28,908
we are seeing some changes in the partial pressure of CO2.

513
00:46:28,908 --> 00:46:31,770
And so we do see arterial PCO2 drop a little

514
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:36,155
bit with this kind of exponential increase in ventilation.

515
00:46:39,938 --> 00:46:44,303
But if we're just talking about untrained individuals,

516
00:46:44,303 --> 00:46:48,166
so graded exercise in untrained individuals, the pulmonary system

517
00:46:48,166 --> 00:46:52,050
is not seen as a limitation during submaximal exercise.

518
00:46:54,848 --> 00:46:59,358
The biggest support for this would be even during

519
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:05,471
hyperventilation, these individuals are able to maintain their arterial PO2.

520
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:12,587
So there's no drop in the partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs.

521
00:47:13,613 --> 00:47:16,658
So in that manner, we're thinking at least the lungs

522
00:47:16,658 --> 00:47:20,383
are able to maintain the partial pressure of oxygen and be

523
00:47:20,383 --> 00:47:23,528
able to encourage diffusion of oxygen into the blood.

524
00:47:23,528 --> 00:47:26,653
And then now there are other problems with delivering that

525
00:47:26,653 --> 00:47:30,299
blood to the tissue, but at least the lungs are doing their job.

526
00:47:34,144 --> 00:47:37,429
No surprise here though, even in untrained individuals, we

527
00:47:37,429 --> 00:47:41,055
are seeing a dramatic drop in the arterial pH.

528
00:47:47,161 --> 00:47:53,148
Okay, so if this is untrained individuals, let's look at trained individuals.

529
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:59,895
So for untrained individuals, we don't believe there's a limitation for the pulmonary system,

530
00:47:59,895 --> 00:48:04,480
but we do have some evidence that suggests that

531
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,044
highly trained elite endurance athletes during maximal exercise

532
00:48:08,044 --> 00:48:13,870
might have some type of mechanical limitation for the lung, right?

533
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:15,312
Even these individuals,

534
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:19,988
their lung is as big as it's going to get.

535
00:48:19,988 --> 00:48:22,694
And so eventually when they're trying to move enough

536
00:48:22,694 --> 00:48:26,643
air into the lungs, there's just mechanical limitations.

537
00:48:26,643 --> 00:48:29,750
We just can't push any more air into the lungs.

538
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:33,098
And so therefore at that point in time, it becomes a little bit problematic.

539
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:37,997
We also see in these highly trained individuals where they're

540
00:48:37,997 --> 00:48:41,482
the ones who are able to fatigue out their muscles

541
00:48:41,482 --> 00:48:45,567
on a more regular basis compared to untrained individuals.

542
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:49,192
Typically if you took a sedentary individual or someone

543
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:52,317
who's even recreationally active and you got them to do

544
00:48:52,317 --> 00:48:55,882
a high intensity exercise, their legs will give out before their lungs.

545
00:48:56,723 --> 00:48:59,747
And that's just because they're just, they're not very active

546
00:48:59,747 --> 00:49:03,372
at that point in time and so they're really not pushing their lungs to the max.

547
00:49:04,432 --> 00:49:07,556
But we do see some respiratory muscle fatigue during

548
00:49:07,556 --> 00:49:14,967
prolonged high intensity exercise for these highly trained athletes.

549
00:49:14,967 --> 00:49:16,709
Another interesting concept here.

550
00:49:16,709 --> 00:49:23,239
40% to 50% of these elite endurance athletes

551
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:31,060
experience something called exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia, where

552
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:37,327
If on this graph we have partial pressure of oxygen on the Y and work rate on the X axis,

553
00:49:37,327 --> 00:49:42,273
that as we increase intensity, there's usually a certain

554
00:49:42,273 --> 00:49:46,537
point around lactate threshold where all of a sudden we get

555
00:49:46,537 --> 00:49:50,542
this dramatic drop in the partial pressure of oxygen.

556
00:49:55,708 --> 00:50:00,493
Any ideas as to why this might happen in these elite athletes?

557
00:50:03,528 --> 00:50:03,708
Yeah.

558
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:14,986
Yeah, what was that last part?

559
00:50:14,986 --> 00:50:17,070
So yeah, I agree that they're working so hard.

560
00:50:27,627 --> 00:50:28,268
Sorry.

561
00:50:28,268 --> 00:50:30,852
I got the lab part, but there's a high partial pressure oxygen.

562
00:50:36,181 --> 00:50:38,925
Yeah, so I agree with you that at a high

563
00:50:38,925 --> 00:50:43,211
intensity exercise, they are unable to maintain this partial

564
00:50:43,211 --> 00:50:45,715
pressure of oxygen inside of the arteries, right?

565
00:50:45,715 --> 00:50:48,679
So typically, we're at 100, and we want to see

566
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:55,630
this 100 all the way throughout all exercise intensities like we see it with the untrained individuals.

567
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:58,894
But what's unique that we've talked about earlier in this slide

568
00:50:58,894 --> 00:51:04,062
deck, as well as some of the other slides, about the trained hands.

569
00:51:06,185 --> 00:51:11,630
Yeah, so the transit time is one of the biggest players that are contributing to this piece here.

570
00:51:14,813 --> 00:51:18,297
And so I guess I should have let you all talk about it, but the transit time.

571
00:51:21,019 --> 00:51:22,260
Well, then let me ask you this.

572
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:29,447
What is causing this substantial decrease in transit time?

573
00:51:29,447 --> 00:51:32,530
Why isn't transit time an issue for the untrained individuals?

574
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,663
has to do something with cardiac output.

575
00:51:43,663 --> 00:51:50,954
What's cardiac output kind of made of?

576
00:51:50,954 --> 00:51:53,577
How can we calculate cardiac output based on the FIC equation?

577
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,663
Heart rate times stroke volume.

578
00:51:58,544 --> 00:52:03,251
Does heart rate typically go up with endurance training?

579
00:52:03,251 --> 00:52:07,537
Or do we see maximum heart rate higher in endurance trained athletes versus untrained?

580
00:52:07,537 --> 00:52:08,718
Yeah, I agree, no.

581
00:52:08,718 --> 00:52:09,840
So it has to be then.

582
00:52:10,732 --> 00:52:11,633
Stroke volume, right?

583
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:15,079
So untrained individuals, we see a plateau in that stroke volume.

584
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:17,924
Then when we see some of the elite groups, we see

585
00:52:17,924 --> 00:52:21,490
either no plateau or very late plateau in stroke volume,

586
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:24,034
which means they have a relatively high cardiac output.

587
00:52:24,034 --> 00:52:26,819
If they have a high cardiac output or stroke volume, then

588
00:52:26,819 --> 00:52:30,645
this blood is gonna be moving past this alveoli much

589
00:52:30,645 --> 00:52:34,832
faster at these higher intensities compared to untrained individuals.

590
00:52:35,842 --> 00:52:43,575
So this is one of the theories as to why we're getting a decrease in this saturation.

591
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:50,546
There's another one, and that has to do with the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve.

592
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:53,952
Any ideas there?

593
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:05,882
Yeah, yeah, I think, yep, and I think I, yeah, there we go, yeah, yeah, yeah.

594
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:08,551
So it's a decrease in pH or increase in acidity, and

595
00:53:08,551 --> 00:53:12,885
typically we see that a little bit of a higher rate compared to these.

596
00:53:14,401 --> 00:53:19,648
untrained individuals, and yeah, there's a small change at

597
00:53:19,648 --> 00:53:23,673
the lungs, at that flat portion, but that also contributes to this piece.

598
00:53:23,673 --> 00:53:28,479
So now you have a little bit of a drop or shift to the right in the partial pressure,

599
00:53:28,479 --> 00:53:32,043
or shift to the right in the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve, so then

600
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:34,727
that partial pressure starts to become a little bit more

601
00:53:34,727 --> 00:53:38,191
of an impact, plus we have this decrease in transit

602
00:53:38,191 --> 00:53:42,957
time, which is really causing this exercise-induced desaturation.

603
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:48,224
There's some other parameters that we'll talk about

604
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:54,850
during altitude, but sometimes there's mixing of oxygenated and

605
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:59,214
deoxygenated blood in the heart due to some anatomical differences,

606
00:53:59,214 --> 00:54:02,117
as well as transit time in other areas.

607
00:54:02,117 --> 00:54:05,761
So we'll touch on this in altitude.

608
00:54:05,761 --> 00:54:06,641
This is more for fun.

609
00:54:10,865 --> 00:54:12,707
OK, any questions up to this point?

610
00:54:15,623 --> 00:54:16,104
All right.

611
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:28,596
Let's move on to Chapter 11 then.

612
00:54:28,596 --> 00:54:30,561
Acid base balance during exercise.

613
00:54:33,545 --> 00:54:37,932
Okay, so for this one, I feel like it's a really good segue because we just talked about

614
00:54:37,932 --> 00:54:41,998
how the ventilatory system is very good at helping us

615
00:54:41,998 --> 00:54:49,109
balance some of these high increases in CO2 and subsequent

616
00:54:49,109 --> 00:54:55,418
increases in hydrogen ions, so we can exhale that and try to defend against those as long as possible.

617
00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:00,937
So it's gonna be a relatively short kind of spec here, but we're gonna go

618
00:55:00,937 --> 00:55:08,068
through the hydrogen, let me get my pointer out, the hydrogen ion production during exercise,

619
00:55:08,068 --> 00:55:12,375
and then how we regulate that balance during exercise, and how

620
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:17,242
the kidneys play a role in this, as well as what happens after exercise.

621
00:55:21,509 --> 00:55:24,173
Okay, hydrogen ion production during exercise.

622
00:55:25,334 --> 00:55:28,762
No surprise because we just saw this, hydrogen production

623
00:55:28,762 --> 00:55:32,370
does depend on exercise intensity and the amount of muscle

624
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,497
mass involved as well as the duration of exercise.

625
00:55:39,646 --> 00:55:41,109
You guys getting a buzzing?

626
00:55:41,109 --> 00:55:42,853
Is that bothersome?

627
00:56:01,143 --> 00:56:02,446
Okay, hopefully that's better.

628
00:56:03,368 --> 00:56:12,729
Okay, duration of exercise, exercise intensity, as well as the amount

629
00:56:12,729 --> 00:56:16,197
or number of muscles that are involved are going to

630
00:56:16,197 --> 00:56:20,687
increase or change the amount of hydrogen ions that are produced.

631
00:56:23,114 --> 00:56:27,407
It should make sense that the location where these hydrogen

632
00:56:27,407 --> 00:56:30,175
ions are being produced in the highest concentration or the most

633
00:56:30,175 --> 00:56:37,373
amounts would be at the muscle and a different concentration than the blood.

634
00:56:37,373 --> 00:56:40,579
So muscle pH declines more dramatically than blood pH.

635
00:56:40,579 --> 00:56:44,886
And we can see that over here on the x-axis that has work rate.

636
00:56:44,886 --> 00:56:49,074
Arterial blood pH, so what's in the blood, and muscle pH here.

637
00:56:49,996 --> 00:56:53,722
So they look like they have the same kind of decline.

638
00:56:53,722 --> 00:57:01,977
But one of the big things would be muscle pH drops first, much earlier in the exercise intensity.

639
00:57:01,977 --> 00:57:05,545
And second, the magnitude of decline is much different.

640
00:57:05,545 --> 00:57:10,816
So here we're going from 6.99, or basically 7 here.

641
00:57:11,738 --> 00:57:13,542
And we're going all the way down to 6.2.

642
00:57:13,542 --> 00:57:19,956
So almost a delta of 0.8, whereas here we're going from 7.4 to 7.

643
00:57:20,778 --> 00:57:21,640
It's almost double.

644
00:57:27,998 --> 00:57:31,163
So then you might ask yourself, what are the sources

645
00:57:31,163 --> 00:57:35,230
that are contributing to this hydrogen ion production in the skeletal muscle?

646
00:57:36,613 --> 00:57:39,378
No surprise here, because we just already talked about it.

647
00:57:39,378 --> 00:57:44,046
Carbonic acid or that CO2 production, that's going to move

648
00:57:44,046 --> 00:57:49,956
or shift the curve down, get carbonic acid, bicarb, then the hydrogen ions.

649
00:57:49,956 --> 00:57:51,238
So you get these hydrogen ions.

650
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:58,870
Any time you go or undergo glycolysis, you create pyruvate.

651
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:04,137
Pyruvate might bump into lactate dehydrogenase and that's gonna create lactate.

652
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:06,841
As soon as you get lactic acid, it immediately

653
00:58:06,841 --> 00:58:10,666
dissociates into lactate and hydrogen ions, so those hydrogen ions are contributing.

654
00:58:12,488 --> 00:58:17,715
Any time you break down ATP, you also are releasing hydrogen ions.

655
00:58:18,556 --> 00:58:21,921
So these are all contributing to this kind of pool

656
00:58:21,921 --> 00:58:32,095
of hydrogen ions that are increasing the acidity or decreasing the pH.

657
00:58:32,095 --> 00:58:36,060
Okay, so let's look at all three of these pieces here in a little bit more detail,

658
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:39,905
not a whole lot more, but production of carbon dioxide comes

659
00:58:39,905 --> 00:58:44,592
from the Krebs cycle, as well as the movement of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.

660
00:58:44,592 --> 00:58:48,728
So any time you move a three carbon to a two carbon,

661
00:58:48,728 --> 00:58:52,893
not anytime, but at least in cellular respiration, you are exhaling a CO2,

662
00:58:52,893 --> 00:58:55,276
and then through the Krebs cycle here, you are releasing,

663
00:58:56,077 --> 00:58:58,240
you are kind of breaking down and building up those

664
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,683
carbon chains, and you're releasing those CO2 molecules.

665
00:59:02,645 --> 00:59:05,128
Again, if you're creating more CO2, you're gonna push this

666
00:59:05,128 --> 00:59:09,573
curve to the right, which then causes an increase in these hydrogen ions.

667
00:59:12,797 --> 00:59:15,761
I just mentioned this production of lactic acid quickly

668
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:18,364
dissociates into lactate as well as this hydrogen.

669
00:59:22,023 --> 00:59:23,205
ATP breakdown.

670
00:59:24,306 --> 00:59:29,032
Well, this also results in a release of a hydrogen ion.

671
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:31,336
So we have ATP hydrolyzes with water.

672
00:59:31,336 --> 00:59:36,282
You get your ADP, your phosphate over here, and then you get your hydrogen ion.

673
00:59:45,655 --> 00:59:46,215
Are we OK here?

674
00:59:47,898 --> 00:59:48,098
All right.

675
00:59:50,525 --> 00:59:54,610
So you might be thinking, okay, yes, increase in hydrogen

676
00:59:54,610 --> 01:00:00,236
ions are decreasing the pH, creating a more acidic environment, which could be problematic.

677
01:00:01,557 --> 01:00:11,569
But how would, or what would the mechanism be for hydrogen ions to maybe impair performance?

678
01:00:11,569 --> 01:00:19,738
One of those would be the inhibition of enzymes anaerobic and anaerobic ATP production.

679
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:22,701
specifically PFK.

680
01:00:23,502 --> 01:00:26,365
So it is a little interesting that PFK, the rate

681
01:00:26,365 --> 01:00:32,153
limiting enzyme for glycolysis, is inhibited or kind of damaged

682
01:00:32,153 --> 01:00:39,423
or unable to function at its normal capacity with a decrease in pH.

683
01:00:41,786 --> 01:00:48,595
So it inhibits enzymes in both the oxidative and non-oxidative formation of ATP.

684
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:54,869
The second piece here, I don't know if I'm gonna be

685
01:00:54,869 --> 01:01:01,736
able to do this, the second one, hydrogen ions can also bind to troponin.

686
01:01:04,878 --> 01:01:07,341
Well, that's a spot for calcium.

687
01:01:09,603 --> 01:01:14,827
If you take up the same spot for calcium, well, now we're not gonna get the conformational change.

688
01:01:14,827 --> 01:01:16,729
So you're not gonna be able to move tropomycin and

689
01:01:16,729 --> 01:01:21,113
open those binding sites for actin to now connect with the myosin head.

690
01:01:22,477 --> 01:01:28,666
So now we're preventing the cross-bridge from forming and

691
01:01:28,666 --> 01:01:34,735
muscles to contract at their full capability if we have too high of a hydrogen ion concentration.

692
01:01:46,293 --> 01:01:51,741
So yeah, independent of pH changes, we can impair performance

693
01:01:53,088 --> 01:01:58,119
through this binding of the troponin.

694
01:01:58,119 --> 01:02:00,824
So it takes up a spot that calcium otherwise would take.

695
01:02:03,029 --> 01:02:05,170
There are other things that

696
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:07,152
kind of are out of the scope of this class,

697
01:02:07,152 --> 01:02:12,437
but high hydrogen ion concentration also disturbs the sarcoplasmic

698
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:15,260
reticulum from kind of releasing and uptaking calcium.

699
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:17,763
So that kind of impairs that area as well.

700
01:02:17,763 --> 01:02:21,707
So these are not the only two areas that hydrogen

701
01:02:21,707 --> 01:02:25,551
ions or a decrease in pH are impairing performance.

702
01:02:25,551 --> 01:02:29,715
These are just the two major ones that you will need to know for this course.

703
01:02:33,779 --> 01:02:34,620
Any questions here?

704
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:45,118
And I feel like I'm gonna get through all of this today, which isn't necessarily bad.

705
01:02:45,118 --> 01:02:48,462
Okay, regulation of acid-base balance during exercise here.

706
01:02:49,964 --> 01:02:53,629
Okay, changes in arterial concentrations of bicarbonate, lactate,

707
01:02:53,629 --> 01:02:56,733
and pH changes during graded exercise tests.

708
01:02:56,733 --> 01:02:58,316
A little bit more of the same story.

709
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:05,265
If I have a baseline kind of bicarb level here,

710
01:03:06,848 --> 01:03:12,474
then that should be enough to maintain pH across some of these easier workloads.

711
01:03:14,817 --> 01:03:19,062
As soon as we have a decrease in pH or substantial

712
01:03:19,062 --> 01:03:22,846
increase in the number of hydrogen ions, we are then going

713
01:03:22,846 --> 01:03:27,952
to utilize the bicarb to then buffer those hydrogen ions.

714
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:32,637
And so the bicarb is going to decrease.

715
01:03:35,013 --> 01:03:38,337
We don't have unlimited amount of bicarb, so the bicarb is

716
01:03:38,337 --> 01:03:42,923
going to decrease, and so the pH is going to continue to decrease.

717
01:03:49,452 --> 01:03:51,915
So the acid-base balance is maintained by buffers.

718
01:03:53,257 --> 01:03:57,122
It releases hydrogen ions when pH is high, so it's a

719
01:03:57,122 --> 01:04:01,408
little too basic, and we need to bring that pH back down to that normal set point.

720
01:04:02,873 --> 01:04:05,536
and it accepts hydrogen ions when pH is low.

721
01:04:08,358 --> 01:04:11,541
So if there are too many hydrogen ions, the buffer will

722
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:22,192
then try to grab onto one of those hydrogens to try to help increase the pH or reduce the acidity.

723
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:26,436
We are more familiar with bicarb, but there are other buffers.

724
01:04:27,977 --> 01:04:32,762
We're gonna talk about those lines of defense against pH changes during exercise.

725
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:36,262
in particular, high intensity exercise.

726
01:04:36,262 --> 01:04:41,507
Because during these lower intensity exercises, maybe submaximal

727
01:04:41,507 --> 01:04:46,351
exercises, we're usually able to maintain the pH relatively well.

728
01:04:46,351 --> 01:04:52,296
It's not until we get to these higher intensity exercises, especially at maximum.

729
01:04:52,296 --> 01:04:53,878
Okay, so the first line of defense.

730
01:04:53,878 --> 01:04:55,379
We're gonna go over two pieces here.

731
01:04:55,379 --> 01:04:58,161
One, the cellular buffer system.

732
01:04:59,463 --> 01:05:03,573
This is inside of the muscle cell or the cell themselves.

733
01:05:03,573 --> 01:05:08,761
It's not until later that we have maybe some blood buffer systems.

734
01:05:08,761 --> 01:05:15,211
So once we get spillover into the blood, then we have the second kind of piece to deal with.

735
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:18,236
So the first line of defense against the muscle pH

736
01:05:18,236 --> 01:05:24,545
changes will be these four major classes of intracellular chemical buffers.

737
01:05:25,847 --> 01:05:30,795
So bicarb, phosphates, proteins, and carnosine.

738
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:37,113
You don't really need to know the magnitude, but in general,

739
01:05:37,113 --> 01:05:43,099
bicarbonate is about 20 to 30% of the buffering capacity inside of the cell.

740
01:05:43,099 --> 01:05:46,402
And then if we're looking at some of these phosphates, they're around 10 to 20%.

741
01:05:47,423 --> 01:05:51,888
And the phosphates are basically converting a strong acid into a weaker acid.

742
01:05:51,888 --> 01:05:56,032
So it doesn't eliminate them, but it definitely attenuates

743
01:05:56,032 --> 01:05:57,994
some of the acidity inside of the solution.

744
01:06:00,416 --> 01:06:04,897
Proteins and carnosine here, they accept

745
01:06:04,897 --> 01:06:09,342
Hydrogen ions, in inside of the cell, they are

746
01:06:09,342 --> 01:06:13,146
responsible for about 60% of the buffering capacity.

747
01:06:14,388 --> 01:06:19,334
So carnosine is quite important in accepting some of those hydrogen ions.

748
01:06:24,139 --> 01:06:27,138
Well, like most things, right, if we have just too much

749
01:06:27,138 --> 01:06:29,421
We have an excess inside of the room.

750
01:06:29,421 --> 01:06:31,323
What's the best way to get rid of it?

751
01:06:31,323 --> 01:06:32,905
Let's just throw it out, right?

752
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:37,130
Like transport the hydrogen ions out of the muscle.

753
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:38,832
Let's get these hydrogen ions out.

754
01:06:38,832 --> 01:06:41,255
We can't buffer it inside of the cell because our

755
01:06:41,255 --> 01:06:45,500
chemical buffering mechanisms are just kind of maxed out.

756
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,402
We can't really handle it anymore.

757
01:06:47,402 --> 01:06:48,403
Time to ship it off.

758
01:06:51,826 --> 01:06:53,170
How do we ship those off?

759
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:56,358
Well, we have two major transporters.

760
01:06:56,358 --> 01:06:59,567
So we have hydrogen ion transporters in the skeletal muscle.

761
01:07:00,609 --> 01:07:02,976
So here we have the interstitial space and then we

762
01:07:02,976 --> 01:07:07,287
have the skeletal muscle where the majority of the hydrogen ions are being produced.

763
01:07:08,903 --> 01:07:11,967
This one over here is a sodium.

764
01:07:11,967 --> 01:07:14,351
So the N is for sodium.

765
01:07:14,351 --> 01:07:16,293
The H is for hydrogen.

766
01:07:16,293 --> 01:07:17,916
And the E is for exchangers.

767
01:07:17,916 --> 01:07:20,759
This is a sodium-hydrogen exchanger.

768
01:07:20,759 --> 01:07:26,828
And so you are, as it sounds, exchanging a sodium for a hydrogen molecule.

769
01:07:26,828 --> 01:07:29,171
So you bring a sodium ion in.

770
01:07:30,152 --> 01:07:31,975
You send the hydrogen molecule out.

771
01:07:34,503 --> 01:07:38,950
This is a mono carboxylate transporter or an MCT transporter.

772
01:07:39,971 --> 01:07:43,717
This one moves lactate as well as hydrogen out at the same time.

773
01:07:51,669 --> 01:08:00,763
Okay, compared to slow type one fibers, fast or type two fibers have a higher buffering capacity.

774
01:08:03,393 --> 01:08:07,738
So on all or both of those, both chemical and the

775
01:08:07,738 --> 01:08:13,824
transporting of the hydrogen ions are a little bit better than some of the type two fibers.

776
01:08:18,669 --> 01:08:21,733
If you undergo high intensity training for prolonged periods

777
01:08:21,733 --> 01:08:27,058
of time, you are improving the chemical kind of buffering capacity.

778
01:08:27,919 --> 01:08:33,265
In particular, you are improving the carnosine as well as the hydrogen ion transporters.

779
01:08:35,624 --> 01:08:40,653
So if you remember, the carnosine was 60% of the chemical buffering capacity.

780
01:08:41,714 --> 01:08:45,822
Well, if you undergo high intensity training, or just

781
01:08:45,822 --> 01:08:49,949
training in general, you are improving the carnosine as well as these transporters here.

782
01:08:59,024 --> 01:08:59,485
Are we good there?

783
01:09:00,346 --> 01:09:00,687
All right.

784
01:09:01,628 --> 01:09:06,497
So we'll start with the second line of defense on Thursday.

785
01:09:06,497 --> 01:09:07,840
We'll finish this up.

786
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:11,427
We'll probably start the physiology of training slides, but just

787
01:09:11,427 --> 01:09:13,872
know that that's not part of your second lecture exam.

788
01:09:15,876 --> 01:09:21,747
Again, if you haven't heard from me and you have exam accommodations, please come talk to me.
