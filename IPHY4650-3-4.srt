1
00:02:22,928 --> 00:02:25,673
All right, welcome back everybody.

2
00:02:25,673 --> 00:02:30,903
Good to see you again.

3
00:02:30,903 --> 00:02:44,650
All right, so we're gonna pick up where we left off on circulatory responses to exercise.

4
00:02:45,794 --> 00:02:49,660
We kind of just got done reviewing the pressure volume loop and maybe

5
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,944
how to read that and how the pressure volume

6
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:57,892
loop is impacting certain things like end-diastolic volume or

7
00:02:57,892 --> 00:03:04,701
how certain factors are impacting how you might read the pressure volume loop like end-diastolic volume.

8
00:03:06,043 --> 00:03:12,713
Maybe that mean arterial pressure or some of that inotropy like contractility.

9
00:03:14,178 --> 00:03:18,906
So this is that figure that kind of summarizes some of the big pieces here.

10
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:23,654
So if we're gonna increase venous return, that's gonna impact diastolic volume.

11
00:03:25,798 --> 00:03:29,925
If we kind of implement the sympathetic nervous system

12
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:36,456
activity or we get some epinephrine coming from the adrenal glands, that's gonna impact contractility.

13
00:03:37,853 --> 00:03:43,599
Afterload can also impact stroke volume due to decreases or increases in arterial pressure.

14
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,841
But if we're talking about an increase in stroke volume,

15
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:48,564
that's a decrease in afterload is going to improve stroke volume.

16
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:55,110
So I think this is always a good little review slide to just check maybe

17
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,454
whether you remember some of the factors, because we talked about several factors

18
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:01,257
that impact end diastolic volume, several factors that

19
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:08,127
impact contractility, and then several factors that talk about arterial pressure or that afterload.

20
00:04:08,127 --> 00:04:10,831
So preload, inotropy, afterload.

21
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:16,119
And we looked at each side, right?

22
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:18,302
Like, is it impacting end diastolic volume?

23
00:04:18,302 --> 00:04:20,105
Is it impacting end systolic volume?

24
00:04:20,105 --> 00:04:21,327
Is it impacting pressure?

25
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:24,652
And we looked at it in these three different kind

26
00:04:24,652 --> 00:04:30,902
of individual ways, but in reality, regulation of stroke volume

27
00:04:30,902 --> 00:04:37,071
during exercise is a little bit more dynamic.

28
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,275
Increasing that stroke volume during exercise is due to multiple different things,

29
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:45,760
as well as the impact of afterload is going to

30
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:52,288
maybe alter stroke volume or prevent stroke volume from maybe going up as much as we might expect.

31
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:03,140
We then looked at this particular overall, I guess, cardiac output formula here.

32
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,964
and then some of the impacts that maybe parasympathetic

33
00:05:05,964 --> 00:05:08,688
nerves can inhibit cardiac rate or heart rate.

34
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,698
About up to what heart rate is a parasympathetic nervous

35
00:05:14,698 --> 00:05:18,503
system and the withdrawal of that system impacting heart rate?

36
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:22,369
About where, as far as beats per minute, does anyone remember?

37
00:05:24,953 --> 00:05:27,477
So if we're at rest, 60 beats per minute,

38
00:05:28,688 --> 00:05:31,571
The primary way we can increase that heart rate

39
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:35,835
is through parasympathetic withdrawal up to a certain point.

40
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,278
Does anyone remember what that point was around?

41
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,201
You can take a guess.

42
00:05:48,328 --> 00:05:49,049
Help me out here.

43
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:53,233
You can look at your notes or you can just take a guess.

44
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:56,316
That's okay, I don't wanna pressure anybody.

45
00:05:58,642 --> 00:05:59,704
100, thank you.

46
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:00,906
Yeah, so up to 100.

47
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:05,633
That's typically primarily done through withdrawal, the

48
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:09,619
parasympathetic nervous system, and then kind of above 100.

49
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:13,064
And again, these are general areas, but above that,

50
00:06:13,064 --> 00:06:17,071
now we're getting more sympathetic nervous system input that's

51
00:06:17,071 --> 00:06:19,735
causing the increase in cardiac heart rate.

52
00:06:19,735 --> 00:06:21,898
And then we talked about these three things here.

53
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,644
Did we end up doing this piece?

54
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:29,188
I think we left off right here.

55
00:06:30,011 --> 00:06:31,174
OK, yeah.

56
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:36,951
So let's kind of get an idea of the stroke vong here for each of these conditions.

57
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:39,715
So the blue, A.

58
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:46,502
This smaller pressure volume loop here, the blue one that is labeled A, is indicating rest.

59
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:52,548
The kind of middle one here, B, is indicating low-intensity cycling.

60
00:06:52,548 --> 00:06:58,755
And the largest one here, C, this red one here, is indicating high-intensity cycling.

61
00:07:00,096 --> 00:07:03,900
So maybe a couple minutes, just try to get a

62
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:10,023
a decent estimate of the stroke volume for these three pressure volume loops.

63
00:07:10,023 --> 00:07:14,717
And then we'll move on in just a second, or a couple minutes, a minute or two.

64
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:11,365
Okay, so hopefully you have a general idea of where these

65
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,769
stroke volumes are for each one of these conditions.

66
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:19,395
Keep in mind that we do have, before we kind of looked at cardiac output,

67
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:25,082
but we do have these typical values for heart rate,

68
00:08:25,082 --> 00:08:29,387
cardiac output, and stroke volume given an individual whether they're

69
00:08:29,387 --> 00:08:34,113
at rest or exercise or male or female and untrained, untrained.

70
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:37,047
So we're gonna take this a little bit further.

71
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:41,675
But given the following cardiac outputs, calculate the heart rate for each one of these.

72
00:08:43,118 --> 00:08:49,088
So find the heart rate for curve A if the cardiac output

73
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:54,718
is 6 liters per minute, and then B, 10.5, and then C, 19 liters per minute.

74
00:10:12,408 --> 00:10:13,549
OK, how are we doing here?

75
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:15,752
Anyone need a little more time?

76
00:10:17,314 --> 00:10:20,998
I guess you don't need to be 100% done here to move on to the next piece.

77
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:36,897
OK, so we'll try some clicker questions.

78
00:10:38,935 --> 00:10:41,218
If you're not done with the calculations, that's okay.

79
00:10:41,218 --> 00:10:47,246
Don't worry, they don't necessarily have to be done, but they could potentially help you out here.

80
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:50,971
So let's try this first one here.

81
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:56,959
Which exercise curve shows an increase in stroke

82
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,867
volume primarily due to an increased contractility or inotropy?

83
00:14:56,836 --> 00:14:59,544
Okay, let's try to get something in.

84
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:06,444
I'll close it down in maybe 20 seconds or so.

85
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:10,356
How are we doing?

86
00:15:23,785 --> 00:15:25,467
Okay, 10 seconds here.

87
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:26,949
Double check you have something in.

88
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:30,113
Five seconds.

89
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,039
Three, two, one.

90
00:15:39,265 --> 00:15:40,106
Okay, how did we do?

91
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:44,572
Oh, that's okay.

92
00:15:44,572 --> 00:15:46,274
I like the enthusiasm.

93
00:15:46,274 --> 00:15:47,636
I was hoping for that too actually.

94
00:15:48,577 --> 00:15:52,662
Okay, so yes, the correct answer is C.

95
00:15:57,704 --> 00:15:58,806
Who wants to help me out with this?

96
00:16:00,068 --> 00:16:01,490
Because there's a lot of moving parts here.

97
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:09,042
So you have to kind of remember, one, what inotropy is, or increased contractility.

98
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:14,110
Two, what does that typically do to the pressure volume loop?

99
00:16:15,031 --> 00:16:20,940
And then three, which one is primarily contributing to the increase in stroke volume here?

100
00:16:23,044 --> 00:16:25,247
Any of those pieces, maybe, can someone help me out?

101
00:16:26,476 --> 00:16:40,198
So increase in contractility is usually due to what?

102
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:46,524
Good, yeah, so typically if you increase contractility, you

103
00:16:46,524 --> 00:16:51,150
do see some increase in pressure a little bit because you're increasing contractility,

104
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:55,475
but the biggest thing you want to look for is the fact that if I'm starting at rest,

105
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:58,119
which is this blue one for end systolic volume, and I

106
00:16:58,119 --> 00:17:02,824
move down, then I have a decrease in end systolic volume, and

107
00:17:02,824 --> 00:17:08,631
a decrease in end systolic volume is going to lead to an increase in stroke volume.

108
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:10,486
Here's the other piece.

109
00:17:10,486 --> 00:17:11,968
What is the mechanism?

110
00:17:11,968 --> 00:17:14,332
It is the sympathetic nervous system, but how does

111
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:17,797
the sympathetic nervous system increase this stroke volume?

112
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,000
What is it releasing?

113
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:32,078
Yeah, good, catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine.

114
00:17:32,078 --> 00:17:37,506
Those typically increase and they're at the highest during what type of intensity of exercise?

115
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,392
high-intensity exercise, right?

116
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:43,673
And so it kind of all checks out.

117
00:17:44,894 --> 00:17:51,761
The primary kind of factor in increasing stroke volume is due to increased contractility.

118
00:17:51,761 --> 00:17:54,624
If we go back to the mechanisms, well, sympathetic

119
00:17:54,624 --> 00:17:58,108
nervous outflow onto those cardiac accelerator nerves is

120
00:17:58,108 --> 00:18:02,051
epinephrine coming from those postsynaptic ganglions and the

121
00:18:02,051 --> 00:18:05,675
adrenal medulla secreting some of the epinephrine, getting

122
00:18:05,675 --> 00:18:09,619
it to be increased concentrations during high-intensity exercise.

123
00:18:11,101 --> 00:18:12,323
OK, so what about this one here?

124
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:18,733
Which exercise curve shows an increase in stroke volume

125
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:21,197
primarily due to an increase in venous return?

126
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:29,650
I'm hoping we're going to do really well on this one, just by process of elimination.

127
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:51,351
Okay, do we have everyone's clicked in?

128
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:52,392
Anyone need a little more time?

129
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:57,617
I'm trying not to look here, because I'm excited, I'm excited.

130
00:20:57,617 --> 00:20:59,298
We're gonna do well on this one.

131
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:01,040
Let's try like 10 more seconds here.

132
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:16,155
Okay, we're missing actually a handful of clickers,

133
00:21:17,502 --> 00:21:20,886
I'll close it down, ooh, there we go.

134
00:21:20,886 --> 00:21:23,890
In three, two, one.

135
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:33,863
That's okay, this is pretty good, nice job.

136
00:21:33,863 --> 00:21:36,326
This is good, I'll take it, I'll take it.

137
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,653
All right, so curve B does show

138
00:21:46,325 --> 00:21:51,673
an increase in stroke volume primarily due to an increase in venous return.

139
00:21:52,735 --> 00:21:56,821
If we look at the original graph, which is rest, this A,

140
00:21:58,603 --> 00:22:02,830
both B and C have an increase in stroke volume.

141
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:11,683
But we're trying to see which piece or which mechanism is primarily increasing the stroke volume.

142
00:22:12,605 --> 00:22:15,316
I would agree that C

143
00:22:15,316 --> 00:22:18,942
does have an increase in end diastolic volume, which

144
00:22:18,942 --> 00:22:21,126
is contributing to the increase in stroke volume.

145
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:27,958
But the magnitude that the end systolic volume decreases

146
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:31,705
is greater at increasing the stroke volume.

147
00:22:32,748 --> 00:22:36,472
So for C, like we talked about on the previous question,

148
00:22:36,472 --> 00:22:39,996
it was primarily due to a decrease in end systolic volume.

149
00:22:39,996 --> 00:22:43,860
So that's why C wouldn't necessarily be a good option here.

150
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,043
B, well, end systolic volume doesn't change at all for

151
00:22:47,043 --> 00:22:52,669
B. The only thing that is increasing over here is the end diastolic volume.

152
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:55,092
If the end diastolic volume is the one that's

153
00:22:55,092 --> 00:23:01,759
primarily responsible for the increase in stroke volume, that's the question in itself right here.

154
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:08,900
Any questions here on this one?

155
00:23:13,785 --> 00:23:16,247
All right.

156
00:23:16,247 --> 00:23:19,731
So let's think about this one for a couple minutes, or maybe just a minute, very quickly.

157
00:23:20,592 --> 00:23:28,800
Mechanistically, we went from low intensity exercise and

158
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:34,426
diastolic volume increase because we increased preload for all the mechanisms that we talked about.

159
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:37,612
But look at that, we went from low intensity to high

160
00:23:37,612 --> 00:23:42,682
intensity and we didn't see an increase in this end-diastolic volume.

161
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:45,688
We instead saw a decrease, so it pushed a little bit down.

162
00:23:48,253 --> 00:23:50,638
Why do we think that's happening?

163
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,742
Let's maybe chat with your neighbors for a couple seconds

164
00:23:52,742 --> 00:23:56,670
and then we'll try to come back together to think about some mechanisms.

165
00:24:38,568 --> 00:24:40,794
OK, what are we thinking here?

166
00:24:42,378 --> 00:24:43,240
That's a little odd.

167
00:24:44,142 --> 00:24:47,992
Increasing end diastolic volume is going to increase systolic volume.

168
00:24:47,992 --> 00:24:54,107
So we want to think that end diastolic volume would increase as we increase exercise intensity.

169
00:24:54,107 --> 00:24:55,110
Did you have your hand up?

170
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,210
Yeah.

171
00:25:01,197 --> 00:25:02,879
That's exactly right, that's exactly right.

172
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:07,524
So at higher intensity exercises, the heart is beating at

173
00:25:07,524 --> 00:25:13,330
a much faster rate, which means there's less time for the ventricles to actually fill.

174
00:25:14,331 --> 00:25:17,214
So in an ideal world, we'd want those ventricles to

175
00:25:17,214 --> 00:25:21,738
fully fill, but if the heart's beating too fast, it's contracting

176
00:25:21,738 --> 00:25:28,973
before we can get a full kind of volume or endostolic volume prior to the next cycle.

177
00:25:28,973 --> 00:25:33,817
So that's why this is quite common to see this end

178
00:25:33,817 --> 00:25:37,981
diastolic volume start to press down a little bit after you

179
00:25:37,981 --> 00:25:41,424
start to get to the higher intensities during exercise.

180
00:25:45,107 --> 00:25:45,507
OK, great job.

181
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:52,433
OK, so now we'll move on to changes in oxygen delivery to the muscles during exercise.

182
00:25:53,274 --> 00:25:57,698
This should remind you, if I'm looking at oxygen in delivery,

183
00:25:58,943 --> 00:26:02,709
Well, that brings in this nice little equation, the Fick equation.

184
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:08,797
This now ties in our concept of cardiac output, which we just covered.

185
00:26:08,797 --> 00:26:12,443
So we now have gone through all of the Q. We're

186
00:26:12,443 --> 00:26:16,449
going to start moving over to this AVO2 difference to get

187
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:20,615
this overall idea of oxygen delivery to the muscles.

188
00:26:20,615 --> 00:26:23,178
Because essentially, that's all we are trying to do to

189
00:26:23,178 --> 00:26:27,685
make sure we can survive or conduct some sort of mechanical work.

190
00:26:29,993 --> 00:26:33,277
As we already have seen during lab, as well as some

191
00:26:33,277 --> 00:26:40,424
of the other examples, oxygen demand by the muscles during exercise is quite a bit higher than rest.

192
00:26:41,906 --> 00:26:44,689
So sometimes it can get 25 times greater than rest.

193
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,355
So that we already know.

194
00:26:50,355 --> 00:26:54,019
We know we need more oxygen as we increase exercise intensity.

195
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,144
What we need to be thinking about now is, how does it do that?

196
00:26:59,002 --> 00:27:02,527
So increased O2 delivery is accomplished by a few things.

197
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:07,916
No surprise if the Fick equation is Q times AVO2 difference.

198
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:13,244
Q, if that increases, well, that's going to increase the O2 delivery.

199
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:24,095
If we have an increase in cardiac output up to about 40% to 60% of VO2 max,

200
00:27:24,095 --> 00:27:28,701
So if we go from rest to about 40 to 60% of

201
00:27:28,701 --> 00:27:33,527
VO2 max, the increases in cardiac output are primarily due to

202
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:37,372
increases in heart rate as well as increases in stroke volume.

203
00:27:37,372 --> 00:27:41,437
So both of these are contributing to the increase in cardiac output.

204
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:50,909
Anytime we get above this threshold, the increase in cardiac

205
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:53,713
output is primarily due to heart rate alone.

206
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,270
We'll talk about some exceptions, but after this

207
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:05,801
range, for most individuals, stroke volume plateaus, therefore, it's

208
00:28:05,801 --> 00:28:08,306
primarily only due to an increase in heart rate.

209
00:28:12,735 --> 00:28:16,022
So then what's kind of this idea of heart rate max?

210
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,596
Well, there are a few different equations we can use to predict heart rate max.

211
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:30,211
There's 220 minus your age, as well as 208 minus 70% of your age.

212
00:28:31,453 --> 00:28:33,616
In lab, we're primarily going to use this one, but

213
00:28:33,616 --> 00:28:36,441
just know that there are two different equations out there.

214
00:28:40,606 --> 00:28:45,914
If I wanted to implement some predictions and heart rate max and see how

215
00:28:45,914 --> 00:28:51,382
that might help me then determine maximum oxygen consumption,

216
00:28:51,382 --> 00:28:55,167
I could predict someone's heart rate max, get a few

217
00:28:55,167 --> 00:29:01,877
submaximal speeds here, extrapolate this because we know it's

218
00:29:01,877 --> 00:29:08,487
relatively linear to their predicted max, and then drop this down to find the peak oxygen uptake.

219
00:29:10,778 --> 00:29:16,606
So this is pretty nice because we can't always measure VO2 max.

220
00:29:18,969 --> 00:29:21,833
So let me ask you this, in what instance would you

221
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:26,440
need to estimate VO2 max just using submaximal heart rate data?

222
00:29:27,421 --> 00:29:29,124
Why do we think we would need to do that?

223
00:29:30,265 --> 00:29:32,969
Because ideally, wouldn't we just wanna measure VO2 max?

224
00:29:34,852 --> 00:29:35,893
Like I would agree with that.

225
00:29:36,934 --> 00:29:38,777
But sometimes we can't do that.

226
00:29:40,563 --> 00:29:43,767
Any ideas as to why we might want to estimate

227
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:52,279
as opposed to directly measure or indirectly measure VO2 max?

228
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:53,381
Maybe we need a few seconds.

229
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:55,584
Yeah, go ahead.

230
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,986
Yeah.

231
00:29:56,986 --> 00:30:00,791
Yeah, I would not want to put my 90-year-old grandma on

232
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:04,215
a VO2 max test and try to trigger some type of cardiac

233
00:30:04,215 --> 00:30:08,862
event just because we need to get an accurate measure of VO2 max.

234
00:30:08,862 --> 00:30:15,630
There are a lot of health implications that would contraindicate a maximal exercise test.

235
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:18,954
In addition, you all have seen it.

236
00:30:18,954 --> 00:30:21,897
We need some really expensive equipment.

237
00:30:21,897 --> 00:30:23,639
You need people to be able to run it.

238
00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:26,943
You need people to be well motivated to undergo it.

239
00:30:26,943 --> 00:30:34,732
So if I wanted to know the VO2 max of everybody here on CU Boulder on the campus,

240
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:40,621
it would not be realistic to try to bring in 50, 60,000 people to do a VOT max test.

241
00:30:40,621 --> 00:30:45,328
Instead, maybe they can get some submaximal heart rates on their own in the gym,

242
00:30:45,328 --> 00:30:47,491
and then we send out a little survey to try to

243
00:30:47,491 --> 00:30:51,958
get some submaximal points, and then we can estimate the VOT max.

244
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:59,069
So maybe like cost, logistics, health, right?

245
00:30:59,069 --> 00:31:01,212
You can imagine a bunch of different things here.

246
00:31:02,153 --> 00:31:07,462
Okay, so it is important that we can get an idea of how to estimate VOT max.

247
00:31:07,462 --> 00:31:11,348
And now that I've shown you and maybe distracted you enough, let's try to answer this one here.

248
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:19,521
Assuming the athletes are the same age and weight, who would have a greater aerobic capacity here?

249
00:32:09,991 --> 00:32:15,900
OK, let's take another minute, maybe less.

250
00:32:42,307 --> 00:32:43,930
About 30 more seconds here.

251
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:57,936
It's a lot simpler than it looks.

252
00:32:57,936 --> 00:32:58,837
15 seconds.

253
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:02,003
Double check you have something at least in.

254
00:33:09,475 --> 00:33:14,219
Okay, close it down here in three, two, one.

255
00:33:19,424 --> 00:33:19,704
Okay.

256
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:23,828
We weren't that close.

257
00:33:23,828 --> 00:33:24,669
We did good though.

258
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:32,155
All right, so the answer is A. Why would this be A?

259
00:33:34,177 --> 00:33:35,699
Can anyone help me out?

260
00:33:35,699 --> 00:33:38,481
Aerobic capacity is kind of indicating what?

261
00:33:38,481 --> 00:33:39,482
Or you can just tell me.

262
00:33:44,693 --> 00:33:46,555
Yeah, that's exactly it, right?

263
00:33:46,555 --> 00:33:51,059
So if someone has a greater aerobic capacity that's looking at VO2 max

264
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:54,321
or larger oxygen uptake, all you are really doing is

265
00:33:54,321 --> 00:33:59,066
just drawing these lines or following these lines all the way up to their predicted max.

266
00:33:59,066 --> 00:34:01,648
And then we drop down here, and their VO2 max is

267
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:05,111
about 2.9 liters per minute, and this one's 3.6 or so.

268
00:34:07,052 --> 00:34:10,576
So athlete A would have the higher VO2 max or

269
00:34:10,576 --> 00:34:13,418
the higher aerobic capacity or the higher oxygen uptake.

270
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:21,877
Okay, going back to changes in stroke volume during exercise,

271
00:34:21,877 --> 00:34:27,967
or I guess we just finished kind of the idea of calculating or estimating heart rate.

272
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:32,053
Now we can look at changes in stroke volume and how that's gonna impact our cardiac output.

273
00:34:32,894 --> 00:34:38,803
From about rest to, again, around that 40 to 60% range,

274
00:34:38,803 --> 00:34:46,695
we get an increase in stroke volume, and then stroke volume starts to plateau in untrained subjects.

275
00:34:48,785 --> 00:34:53,792
This is because of that decrease in filling time with

276
00:34:53,792 --> 00:35:02,563
the higher kind of cardiac psych or beats per minute heart rate.

277
00:35:02,563 --> 00:35:05,747
Like what we talked about before in the pressure volume

278
00:35:05,747 --> 00:35:12,136
loop, we get a decrease in end diastolic volume and that leads

279
00:35:12,136 --> 00:35:17,543
to a decrease or an overall plateau of that stroke volume.

280
00:35:19,649 --> 00:35:24,717
Keep in mind though, it has been thought that kind

281
00:35:24,717 --> 00:35:28,442
of this elite group, we're talking maybe like Olympic

282
00:35:28,442 --> 00:35:35,653
development or Olympic type caliber athletes, it appears that

283
00:35:35,653 --> 00:35:42,663
their stroke volume does not plateau or plateaus at a much higher percent of VO2 max.

284
00:35:44,085 --> 00:35:48,492
And so this top line here is indicating the elite group

285
00:35:49,535 --> 00:35:52,926
And as we increase in heart rate, stroke volume does not

286
00:35:52,926 --> 00:35:56,277
appear to plateau at least at this point in time, but it

287
00:35:56,277 --> 00:36:00,692
does start to level off a little bit down towards heart rate max.

288
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:05,451
But even in the trained group, we typically still see

289
00:36:05,451 --> 00:36:08,916
a higher stroke volume than the untrained group, or at least

290
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:12,122
a higher point in time where the stroke volume plateaus.

291
00:36:12,122 --> 00:36:14,386
And that's why we have that range where we say between

292
00:36:14,386 --> 00:36:20,737
40 and 60% increases in cardiac output are primarily due to heart rate and stroke volume.

293
00:36:20,737 --> 00:36:24,163
But then above the 40 and 60 is only heart rate.

294
00:36:24,163 --> 00:36:27,388
That range kind of depends on the individual as well as their fitness.

295
00:36:32,448 --> 00:36:38,456
Another piece that can impact stroke volume is body position or body position during exercise.

296
00:36:39,257 --> 00:36:41,980
So here we have supine and upright exercise.

297
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,744
So supine's over here, so they're kind of laying down.

298
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,167
If they're laying down, we don't really have to worry

299
00:36:47,167 --> 00:36:49,870
too much about getting that blood back up towards the

300
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:53,415
heart because it's already more filling towards the heart.

301
00:36:53,415 --> 00:36:55,938
So you have that increase in central venous pressure.

302
00:36:55,938 --> 00:37:00,466
So no surprise here, we have a higher stroke volume compared to an upright position

303
00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:02,309
where we have to work a little bit harder to get all

304
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:07,417
the blood from the bottom of our legs back up towards the heart.

305
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:10,142
So you have a smaller or lower stroke volume here.

306
00:37:15,631 --> 00:37:19,580
You've already seen this graph, so I'm gonna go ahead and skip this.

307
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:25,789
All right, number two, increased O2 delivery is also accomplished by redistribution of blood flow.

308
00:37:27,471 --> 00:37:32,138
So we are taking some of that cardiac output from the inactive organs,

309
00:37:32,138 --> 00:37:35,323
and when we say inactive, we're not saying like they

310
00:37:35,323 --> 00:37:41,451
now shut off, it's just they're not primarily active or contributing

311
00:37:41,451 --> 00:37:46,178
to the given work that we're trying to do.

312
00:37:49,988 --> 00:37:52,131
So that's this redistribution of blood flow here.

313
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:56,816
So increased blood flow to the working skeletal muscles.

314
00:37:56,816 --> 00:38:00,020
A lot of that blood is going to be redirected

315
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:06,308
from some of the organs that aren't necessarily being active in that given work.

316
00:38:06,308 --> 00:38:09,792
So at rest, 15% to 20% of the cardiac output goes to

317
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:15,960
the muscles, but it increases to about 80% to 85% during maximal exercise.

318
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,575
So there's a substantial amount

319
00:38:18,575 --> 00:38:20,978
a blood that's being redirected towards the muscles.

320
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,405
The majority of the redirection is because we're decreasing

321
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:28,950
the blood flow to the liver, the kidneys, the GI tract.

322
00:38:33,717 --> 00:38:37,242
So we can see this is percent VO2 max here.

323
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:41,682
And spinic blood flow is basically kind of redirecting some

324
00:38:41,682 --> 00:38:44,225
of the blood flow to these areas over here.

325
00:38:44,225 --> 00:38:48,489
That decreases as we go to maximal exercise, but muscle blood flow increases.

326
00:38:50,851 --> 00:38:52,833
So liver, kidneys, GI tract.

327
00:38:55,576 --> 00:39:02,783
What other places have we talked about that start maybe changing the redistribution of blood flow?

328
00:39:06,466 --> 00:39:07,127
Any ideas?

329
00:39:11,073 --> 00:39:14,498
So is it always going to go to the muscle when we increase in exercise intensity?

330
00:39:15,699 --> 00:39:17,101
Yeah, it definitely goes to other.

331
00:39:17,101 --> 00:39:19,945
We definitely need some blood flow at the brain and the heart.

332
00:39:20,987 --> 00:39:22,108
So those are good.

333
00:39:22,108 --> 00:39:22,609
Anywhere else?

334
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:31,902
Yeah, the skin for thermoregulation.

335
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:32,743
So that's one.

336
00:39:37,718 --> 00:39:42,599
Yeah, I like the idea there, but typically we redirect blood flow from that area.

337
00:39:43,483 --> 00:39:45,177
It's a good thought, though.

338
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:47,300
The lungs, yeah, the respiratory tissues.

339
00:39:48,562 --> 00:39:54,992
It actually takes a substantial amount of blood flow away from the working muscles to the lungs.

340
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:57,395
They even termed it respiratory steel.

341
00:39:58,717 --> 00:40:01,221
So there was a lot of research coming out in like

342
00:40:01,221 --> 00:40:05,327
the 90s out of Dempsey's group, and they looked at

343
00:40:05,327 --> 00:40:10,675
respiratory muscle work compromising leg blood flow during maximal exercise.

344
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:15,023
They did a really cool study where they increased and decreased the work of breathing.

345
00:40:15,023 --> 00:40:17,908
So down here on the x-axis, they have work of breathing.

346
00:40:17,908 --> 00:40:20,773
100% is just normal.

347
00:40:20,773 --> 00:40:23,919
So that's how much effort you would have to put in

348
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:27,165
to get your lungs to kind of inflate and deflate.

349
00:40:28,495 --> 00:40:33,462
What they ended up doing is made it easier by using a proportional assist ventilator.

350
00:40:33,462 --> 00:40:37,927
So it's just a ventilator they put on them, and it kind of forces air into the lungs.

351
00:40:37,927 --> 00:40:42,934
So you really just, you don't have to put a lot of effort into getting more air into the lungs.

352
00:40:42,934 --> 00:40:45,698
So you decrease the work of breathing, or decrease

353
00:40:45,698 --> 00:40:48,922
the work that the respiratory muscles are doing.

354
00:40:48,922 --> 00:40:51,425
Then they increased the work of breathing.

355
00:40:51,425 --> 00:40:56,508
So they made it substantially harder to breathe or move air in.

356
00:40:56,508 --> 00:40:59,434
If you were to take a guess, what's the easiest way do

357
00:40:59,434 --> 00:41:02,339
you think you can get someone to make it really, really hard to breathe?

358
00:41:03,722 --> 00:41:04,203
Any ideas?

359
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,473
Like a mask?

360
00:41:09,473 --> 00:41:11,076
Yeah, a mask would be good.

361
00:41:11,076 --> 00:41:13,180
But even more, like a mask would make it harder to breathe.

362
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,985
But what's the way we can do it really hard?

363
00:41:17,247 --> 00:41:19,911
Lower oxygen is a good idea, but that actually

364
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:24,037
decreases partial pressure as opposed to putting more effort on the respiratory muscles.

365
00:41:24,037 --> 00:41:26,440
They essentially had them breathe through a straw.

366
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,124
They had them do maximal exercise and have them breathe through a straw.

367
00:41:29,124 --> 00:41:30,726
So they're really, really working hard.

368
00:41:32,809 --> 00:41:38,317
So once they increased the work of breathing, made it really, really difficult, they saw

369
00:41:38,317 --> 00:41:41,301
that the cue to the legs or the cardiac output to

370
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:45,246
the legs started to decrease with an increase in work of breathing.

371
00:41:45,246 --> 00:41:46,528
But it increased.

372
00:41:47,487 --> 00:41:50,143
due to a decrease in work of breathing.

373
00:41:51,371 --> 00:41:53,579
Well, then someone could say, well,

374
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:57,885
You're just redirecting blood flow, maybe more blood flow to

375
00:41:57,885 --> 00:42:00,288
the muscles, less blood flow to the muscles.

376
00:42:00,288 --> 00:42:04,354
How do we know that's actually increasing or decreasing oxygen uptake?

377
00:42:04,354 --> 00:42:05,476
Well, they looked at that, too.

378
00:42:05,476 --> 00:42:11,724
So VO2 in the legs, they ran arterial lines all the way down to the muscles to exercise.

379
00:42:11,724 --> 00:42:14,108
So they had one in the arteries and then one in the vein.

380
00:42:14,108 --> 00:42:18,233
And they just looked at the oxygen before it reached the muscle bed and then afterwards.

381
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:20,056
And then you have a VO2 difference there.

382
00:42:20,056 --> 00:42:21,781
It's a really cool study.

383
00:42:21,781 --> 00:42:24,328
So they looked at the VO2 at the legs directly.

384
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:30,645
And indeed, with a lower work of breathing, it increased the VO2 at the legs.

385
00:42:30,645 --> 00:42:36,357
And an increase in work of breathing decreased the oxygen consumption at the legs.

386
00:42:36,357 --> 00:42:39,102
So this was a really, really good study here.

387
00:42:39,102 --> 00:42:45,093
They then, not this group, but another group, actually looked and saw the blood flow,

388
00:42:45,093 --> 00:42:47,437
the cardiac output to the respiratory muscles as well

389
00:42:47,437 --> 00:42:50,242
as oxygen consumption at the respiratory muscles.

390
00:42:50,242 --> 00:42:53,848
And they confirmed that side of it too, but that happened maybe 15 years later,

391
00:42:53,848 --> 00:42:55,552
just because it was a little bit harder to get blood

392
00:42:55,552 --> 00:42:59,138
flow as well as oxygen consumption at the respiratory muscles.

393
00:42:59,138 --> 00:43:01,001
Because at first, they're like, oh, yeah, well, you're taking

394
00:43:01,001 --> 00:43:03,504
it away from the legs and bringing it to the legs.

395
00:43:03,504 --> 00:43:05,167
But we don't know where it's going.

396
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:07,510
Well, now we know it's going to the respiratory muscles.

397
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:10,795
And you all have probably experienced this.

398
00:43:10,795 --> 00:43:13,780
If you have exercise at a higher intensity, sometimes

399
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:17,165
you can feel, like maybe the respiratory muscles or your lungs,

400
00:43:17,165 --> 00:43:20,209
as sometimes people call it, start to get a little tired.

401
00:43:20,209 --> 00:43:24,235
Or you can tell that they're working a little bit harder at those higher intensity exercises.

402
00:43:27,286 --> 00:43:33,016
The other thing to keep in mind though is when we have some type of redistribution of blood flow,

403
00:43:33,016 --> 00:43:37,664
even though we're going from maybe, I don't know, 15% in

404
00:43:37,664 --> 00:43:45,578
the brain to three to 4%, it's not necessarily saying that you're getting less blood flow to the brain.

405
00:43:45,578 --> 00:43:51,488
It's just a fraction of the overall cardiac output of five liters per minute.

406
00:43:53,071 --> 00:43:55,634
So yeah, it's a lower percent, but you're taking a

407
00:43:55,634 --> 00:44:00,841
lower percent of a higher cardiac output and actually gets pretty close to what it was at rest.

408
00:44:02,022 --> 00:44:04,505
Again, that's because we don't want to eliminate blood flow

409
00:44:04,505 --> 00:44:08,710
to the brain or eliminate blood flow to the digestive tract.

410
00:44:09,511 --> 00:44:14,277
It's just we would rather send more of it to other areas.

411
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:17,161
And if we have a higher cardiac output, well, sometimes

412
00:44:17,161 --> 00:44:22,487
that can kind of account for the decrease in relative distribution of blood flow.

413
00:44:23,547 --> 00:44:26,254
That's where this diagram comes into play.

414
00:44:27,778 --> 00:44:30,024
I'll have you fill this out on your own time here

415
00:44:30,024 --> 00:44:37,082
so you can calculate the absolute blood flow at rest and then the average blood flow during exercise.

416
00:44:37,082 --> 00:44:39,747
And then you can compare it to rest.

417
00:44:39,747 --> 00:44:43,313
So we know kind of what happens on a relative basis, but

418
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:48,320
now it would be good to use these values here, so 25 liters per minute.

419
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,165
Just multiply the fractions here by that.

420
00:44:51,165 --> 00:44:53,649
Put that one in the second row.

421
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,351
And then you could do the same thing for rest,

422
00:44:55,351 --> 00:44:57,735
five liters per minute, and then multiply these across.

423
00:44:58,797 --> 00:45:01,361
You'll see you actually get a decent amount of blood

424
00:45:01,361 --> 00:45:08,151
flow in some of these smaller areas, but nowhere near what we would have kind of in different situations.

425
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:17,419
The magnitude of these redistributions do depend on metabolic rate.

426
00:45:18,681 --> 00:45:22,026
If I'm exercising at a higher intensity and the

427
00:45:22,026 --> 00:45:26,773
muscles are demanding an increase in oxygen consumption or

428
00:45:26,773 --> 00:45:31,801
energy production, well, the magnitude of these redistributions are gonna get bigger.

429
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:36,464
So here we have exercise intensity and then cardiac output over here.

430
00:45:36,464 --> 00:45:39,214
So this one right here in the center, this kind of

431
00:45:39,214 --> 00:45:44,274
orangish color here, this is blood flow or cardiac output to the muscles.

432
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:47,095
That is now increasing.

433
00:45:47,095 --> 00:45:50,480
as we go from rest to high intensity exercise.

434
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:57,389
The kidneys are taking a substantial decrease as we go from rest to exercise.

435
00:45:57,389 --> 00:46:02,175
And you can kind of look at the remaining here, but this is kind of nice.

436
00:46:02,175 --> 00:46:04,439
This is an absolute.

437
00:46:04,439 --> 00:46:06,682
So this is cardiac output liters per minute.

438
00:46:07,763 --> 00:46:14,352
The kidneys are decreasing, but not as much as what we would expect from this piece here.

439
00:46:20,474 --> 00:46:24,823
Okay.

440
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,188
So then the next question should be, look at all

441
00:46:27,188 --> 00:46:32,900
of this blood being redirected to the muscles required for locomotion.

442
00:46:33,982 --> 00:46:35,686
So I'm starting to work out or run.

443
00:46:35,686 --> 00:46:37,690
I'm activating these muscles.

444
00:46:38,817 --> 00:46:43,988
But what is actually telling the body to send more blood to those muscles?

445
00:46:43,988 --> 00:46:46,052
The heart does not determine where the blood goes.

446
00:46:46,052 --> 00:46:48,638
The heart just pumps blood and more blood comes out, right?

447
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,187
There has to be some type of signal in the muscles to say,

448
00:46:53,187 --> 00:46:57,737
or the body to say, hey, I want to send the blood to a certain area.

449
00:46:59,337 --> 00:47:02,200
This is where we get into this concept here.

450
00:47:03,301 --> 00:47:07,306
So the regulation or even the redistribution of muscle

451
00:47:07,306 --> 00:47:11,911
blood flow during exercise is primarily mediated by local factors.

452
00:47:13,012 --> 00:47:17,257
So it's not that you're trying to say I want to send blood to the muscles.

453
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:23,266
It's some type of auto-regulation at the muscles themselves.

454
00:47:23,266 --> 00:47:26,351
So there's intrinsic control of blood flow by increasing

455
00:47:26,351 --> 00:47:31,680
local metabolites that lead to a vasodilation in that area.

456
00:47:32,782 --> 00:47:37,430
If you have a vasodilation inside of the kind of blood

457
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:42,439
vessels at the muscle, you all of a sudden get a change in pressure.

458
00:47:43,246 --> 00:47:45,589
you get a large decrease in pressure in that area and

459
00:47:45,589 --> 00:47:48,872
all of a sudden by default from what we learned about on

460
00:47:48,872 --> 00:47:53,757
the change of pressure and blood flow, blood flow will be redirected to that area.

461
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:57,782
As soon as you get a huge drop in pressure at

462
00:47:57,782 --> 00:48:04,589
the muscles, well then the body has to compensate and say, whoa, that was kind of extreme over here.

463
00:48:04,589 --> 00:48:09,034
Everything else kind of vasoconstricts to maintain perfusion pressure to the rest of the body.

464
00:48:12,203 --> 00:48:13,465
Are we okay with that concept?

465
00:48:14,666 --> 00:48:19,172
If all of a sudden all these blood vessels here vasodilate,

466
00:48:20,013 --> 00:48:21,896
that would cause a little bit of a problem.

467
00:48:23,238 --> 00:48:25,681
And I think we may have experienced this every now and

468
00:48:25,681 --> 00:48:30,307
then, where if you're laying down, you get up too fast and all the blood rushes down.

469
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,831
I think we talked about that, that if you didn't try

470
00:48:32,831 --> 00:48:36,475
to maintain perfusion pressure to the rest of the place, that would be a problem.

471
00:48:36,475 --> 00:48:40,641
And so naturally everything else starts to vasoconstrict.

472
00:48:41,853 --> 00:48:46,440
It's a local factor, local factors that are contributing

473
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,308
to promote vasodilation to increase blood flow to the working muscles.

474
00:48:53,131 --> 00:48:59,661
There are other theories that kind of contribute to this, just like the muscle pump theory, right?

475
00:48:59,661 --> 00:49:01,684
Like if you just contract that blood vessel and

476
00:49:01,684 --> 00:49:05,650
let go, then that's automatically going to encourage blood to go there.

477
00:49:06,507 --> 00:49:12,515
But I guess the primary factor would be any of these local metabolites here.

478
00:49:12,515 --> 00:49:15,219
You don't need to memorize any of these local metabolites

479
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:20,466
in these parentheses, but in the past I've got the question of what are those?

480
00:49:20,466 --> 00:49:22,248
So I just put them in here as an example.

481
00:49:24,451 --> 00:49:26,173
The one thing, you don't need to know this, but the

482
00:49:26,173 --> 00:49:31,941
one thing that I don't really like, how the textbook and a lot of figures depict how the

483
00:49:33,592 --> 00:49:35,854
blood vessels are open or closed.

484
00:49:36,715 --> 00:49:40,239
Here during rest at this muscle capillary bed, it's

485
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:43,302
almost assuming that there's no blood flow here.

486
00:49:44,604 --> 00:49:47,787
So we actually know now that there is blood flow to

487
00:49:47,787 --> 00:49:51,231
these areas, but there's just a very small amount of blood

488
00:49:51,231 --> 00:49:54,535
flow, plus the hematocrit goes way, way, way down.

489
00:49:54,535 --> 00:49:58,799
So it's mostly like plasma and maybe a few red blood cells that are going through here.

490
00:49:58,799 --> 00:50:03,629
So there is flow going through all of these muscular beds here.

491
00:50:03,629 --> 00:50:08,576
And they just vasodilate, and then we redirect blood flow during high-intensity exercise.

492
00:50:08,576 --> 00:50:12,983
So nothing's really closed or absent of blood flow.

493
00:50:12,983 --> 00:50:14,705
There's just a very, very small amount.

494
00:50:19,172 --> 00:50:20,053
Any questions on this?

495
00:50:24,379 --> 00:50:24,599
Nice.

496
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:31,338
So that was Q, cardiac output.

497
00:50:31,338 --> 00:50:35,691
Let's move on to the AVO2 difference here.

498
00:50:35,691 --> 00:50:40,065
A higher arterial venous difference or the AVO2 difference.

499
00:50:41,733 --> 00:50:44,857
is due to, or if we're going to define it first, it's

500
00:50:44,857 --> 00:50:50,085
just the amount of oxygen that is taken up from 100 milliliters of blood.

501
00:50:50,085 --> 00:50:54,892
So this A represents the arterial side, the V represents

502
00:50:54,892 --> 00:51:01,902
the venous side, and it's saying the O2 content in the arteries and the O2 content in the veins.

503
00:51:04,565 --> 00:51:11,513
If we have exercise intensity here on the x-axis and the AVO2 difference here on the y-axis,

504
00:51:11,513 --> 00:51:16,038
we see that as we go from rest to maximum exercise,

505
00:51:16,038 --> 00:51:21,163
there is a slight increase or a continual increase in the AVO2 difference.

506
00:51:23,726 --> 00:51:25,788
No surprise, right?

507
00:51:25,788 --> 00:51:28,511
We want to deliver more oxygen to the muscles.

508
00:51:29,452 --> 00:51:34,538
The muscles take up more oxygen, so we can use it for oxidative phosphorylation.

509
00:51:38,332 --> 00:51:42,398
This is a nice little figure here, but I think the next one does a little bit of a better job.

510
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,769
So in general, if I have A and B over here, this

511
00:51:48,769 --> 00:51:52,935
is a muscle at rest, and this one's a muscle during intense aerobic exercise.

512
00:51:54,798 --> 00:51:56,661
The amount of blood

513
00:51:57,822 --> 00:52:03,530
In these two given scenarios, if they're just equal, we're not changing training

514
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:06,874
or blood doping or something like that, the amount of

515
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:10,179
blood being delivered to the muscles is constant.

516
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:16,828
If I have 100% SPO2 or 100% arterial oxygen saturation,

517
00:52:16,828 --> 00:52:20,573
well, the amount of blood that's being carried is always going to be constant or the same.

518
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:27,212
It passes through the capillary, goes to the vein, but over here, you can imagine,

519
00:52:27,212 --> 00:52:30,277
or you can draw like a little muscle here, the oxygen

520
00:52:30,277 --> 00:52:34,763
is gonna diffuse from the capillary to the muscle.

521
00:52:34,763 --> 00:52:39,129
Whatever is left over, so we went from 20 mils to 15

522
00:52:39,129 --> 00:52:41,993
to 16 mils of oxygen per 100 milliliters of blood.

523
00:52:44,677 --> 00:52:48,282
Well, that is the AVO2 difference.

524
00:52:50,135 --> 00:52:52,199
So we are just taking the difference here.

525
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:57,109
So this is the amount of arterial oxygen content or the amount of oxygen in the arteries.

526
00:52:57,109 --> 00:52:59,193
This is the amount of oxygen in the veins.

527
00:52:59,193 --> 00:53:05,325
This right here is the AVO2 difference, which is depicted similarly over here.

528
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:12,336
Once we start to increase exercise intensity, well, the

529
00:53:12,336 --> 00:53:16,561
amount of oxygen per 100 milliliters of blood is the same,

530
00:53:16,561 --> 00:53:18,944
just what we talked about before because of SBO2.

531
00:53:19,945 --> 00:53:24,231
But now there's a greater demand at the muscle.

532
00:53:24,231 --> 00:53:28,762
We're working harder, so we need to uptake more oxygen.

533
00:53:28,762 --> 00:53:32,227
So now instead of a delta of four to five and the veins

534
00:53:32,227 --> 00:53:37,835
have 15 to 16, we have a delta of 15 and we leave over like five milliliters of blood.

535
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,524
The venous content decreases.

536
00:53:45,426 --> 00:53:50,032
The arterial content remains relatively steady.

537
00:53:52,015 --> 00:53:54,178
This is not at zero.

538
00:53:56,538 --> 00:53:59,781
Is that saying that our muscles don't take everything up?

539
00:54:02,464 --> 00:54:04,806
It's kind of implied in the term here.

540
00:54:04,806 --> 00:54:07,028
But why do we think this is not at zero?

541
00:54:12,193 --> 00:54:15,617
So it's called mixed venous content.

542
00:54:15,617 --> 00:54:22,644
In this particular study, they grabbed the venous O2 content in the vena cava, next to the heart.

543
00:54:23,564 --> 00:54:25,186
So why wouldn't that be at zero?

544
00:54:25,186 --> 00:54:26,207
Why aren't we at zero?

545
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:35,275
So typically, the muscles take almost everything.

546
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:40,922
It wouldn't make sense that we leave some oxygen here,

547
00:54:40,922 --> 00:54:43,085
especially if we can consume all of the oxygen.

548
00:54:45,508 --> 00:54:48,111
Why are we not at zero with the mixed venous content?

549
00:54:51,035 --> 00:54:51,616
Any ideas?

550
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,743
Are the muscles the only place consuming oxygen?

551
00:54:58,625 --> 00:54:58,945
No.

552
00:55:00,173 --> 00:55:06,549
We have inactive areas, so like my arms, they're closer to this top one.

553
00:55:07,632 --> 00:55:11,241
So they have a higher venous O2 content, and then you mix them in the heart

554
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:15,030
so some of the inactive areas aren't consuming all of the

555
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:17,777
oxygen, and you get a little bit of an elevation here.

556
00:55:19,462 --> 00:55:22,488
So this isn't necessarily saying that the muscle is

557
00:55:22,488 --> 00:55:26,235
leaving five milliliters of O2 per 100 milliliters of blood.

558
00:55:26,235 --> 00:55:27,438
It's possible it does.

559
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,584
But since we're sampling it in kind of the

560
00:55:30,584 --> 00:55:34,292
heart, where everything's bringing the venous O2 content from

561
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:41,065
all of the other areas, that doesn't necessarily mean that it is or isn't at zero at the muscle here.

562
00:55:47,204 --> 00:55:49,929
Okay, circulatory responses to exercise here.

563
00:55:52,534 --> 00:55:57,925
Elevated heart rate and blood pressure in emotionally charged environment.

564
00:55:59,127 --> 00:56:02,473
This can happen to an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity.

565
00:56:03,335 --> 00:56:07,572
This can increase pre-exercise heart rate and blood pressure.

566
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:12,467
But no surprise, it does not increase peak heart rate or blood pressure during exercise.

567
00:56:12,467 --> 00:56:14,674
And we kind of saw that with that Murdoch study in

568
00:56:14,674 --> 00:56:19,067
your lab where they put an artificial pacemaker and increased heart rate.

569
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,484
doesn't really do a whole lot there.

570
00:56:22,385 --> 00:56:25,368
So it doesn't matter how amped up you are or how

571
00:56:25,368 --> 00:56:29,833
much Rocky the Three soundtrack I had the tiger you're listening

572
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:33,076
to, you're not going to be able to increase your maximum heart rate.

573
00:56:33,076 --> 00:56:36,880
But it definitely would put, well, not definitely, but if you

574
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,665
enjoy this type of music to get you kind of hyped up, that would increase your pre-exercise heart rate.

575
00:56:42,826 --> 00:56:46,750
So we know there's this influence of kind of that

576
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:49,813
sympathetic outflow to be able to increase your heart rate.

577
00:56:52,595 --> 00:56:57,704
This transition topic, we've already discussed this, but is the rapid increase in heart rate

578
00:56:57,704 --> 00:57:02,533
and stroke volume as well as cardiac output, so cardiac output increases, stroke volume increases,

579
00:57:02,533 --> 00:57:06,621
and heart rate increases, until we can finally match

580
00:57:06,621 --> 00:57:13,253
the steady state value to ensure we're getting the adequate amount of oxygen delivery to the muscles.

581
00:57:19,342 --> 00:57:24,250
Kind of the same story, but we're just adding another variable here, blood pressure.

582
00:57:26,413 --> 00:57:32,183
So cardiac output increases, and then there's a change here in slope.

583
00:57:34,747 --> 00:57:36,449
Why do we have a change in slope right here?

584
00:57:37,812 --> 00:57:41,117
So cardiac output over intensity, we're increasing to about

585
00:57:41,117 --> 00:57:43,020
40%, and then there's a change in slope.

586
00:57:44,755 --> 00:57:47,579
Yeah, the stroke volume's plateauing off, so now we get a

587
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:50,123
little bit of a decrease in the slope, but we still

588
00:57:50,123 --> 00:57:54,689
increase in cardiac output because it's primarily due to an increase in heart rate.

589
00:57:54,689 --> 00:57:56,331
Heart rate's pretty linear.

590
00:57:56,331 --> 00:57:58,875
Blood pressure's pretty linear as well.

591
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:01,739
Mean arterial pressure is also linear, but just at a

592
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:04,343
lower intercept, so it's kind of pushed down a little bit.

593
00:58:05,404 --> 00:58:10,091
Diastolic blood pressure, we expect it to remain pretty steady.

594
00:58:10,091 --> 00:58:12,214
If anything, it might have a slight decrease.

595
00:58:14,776 --> 00:58:17,702
Increase in diastolic blood pressure would be a little bit of a problem.

596
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:18,804
That's a contraindication.

597
00:58:22,993 --> 00:58:31,350
OK, what about these responses to arm and leg exercise at the same oxygen uptake?

598
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:37,275
Arm work results in higher blood pressure as well as a higher heart rate.

599
00:58:38,095 --> 00:58:41,018
The blood pressure is because you get some vasoconstriction

600
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:44,502
in the areas that you aren't sending the blood to.

601
00:58:44,502 --> 00:58:47,665
So kind of reverse of what we talked to with the leg exercise.

602
00:58:47,665 --> 00:58:50,208
If I start doing arm exercises or I'm on an

603
00:58:50,208 --> 00:58:56,775
arm crank ergometer, you're gonna vasodilate the blood vessels

604
00:58:56,775 --> 00:59:02,721
to supply those arm muscles and then vasoconstrict in the other areas like your legs.

605
00:59:04,321 --> 00:59:07,885
So blood pressure would increase at the same oxygen

606
00:59:07,885 --> 00:59:11,689
uptake compared to leg exercises, and same with heart rate.

607
00:59:14,372 --> 00:59:15,914
And this should make sense, right?

608
00:59:15,914 --> 00:59:21,920
If you tried to send all of the blood to the arm muscles compared to the leg muscles,

609
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,763
well, by default, you're sending a lot of blood to

610
00:59:24,763 --> 00:59:27,426
a smaller region, and that's going to increase blood pressure.

611
00:59:34,409 --> 00:59:36,392
Okay, what about intermittent exercise?

612
00:59:39,276 --> 00:59:41,840
You've probably noticed this, but recovery of heart rate and

613
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,503
blood pressure does depend on a few things.

614
00:59:44,503 --> 00:59:47,628
If an individual's a little bit more fit after exercise,

615
00:59:47,628 --> 00:59:51,834
we start to recover a little bit faster, your heart rate decreases a little bit faster.

616
00:59:52,695 --> 00:59:57,041
Temperature and humidity, well, that's just kind of a byproduct of intensity.

617
00:59:58,163 --> 01:00:00,987
And then duration and intensity of the exercise.

618
01:00:00,987 --> 01:00:06,040
So here in blue, we have kind of an increase in watts.

619
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,606
So these are like intermittent or interval exercises, and

620
01:00:08,606 --> 01:00:12,556
then it decreases and then increases, decreases, increases, decreases.

621
01:00:12,556 --> 01:00:13,980
That's this blue line here.

622
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:18,571
So the power output is the same at all of the intervals and the rest.

623
01:00:18,571 --> 01:00:24,519
But this green little line here, we get an increase in heart rate, as expected.

624
01:00:24,519 --> 01:00:28,965
But during the rest, it's not enough time for our heart rate to fully recover.

625
01:00:28,965 --> 01:00:30,667
And then we go to the next bout, and then our

626
01:00:30,667 --> 01:00:36,194
heart rate starts to increase a little bit, and sometimes it even increases higher than the previous one.

627
01:00:36,194 --> 01:00:38,357
And you get this little step increase with heart

628
01:00:38,357 --> 01:00:42,402
rate with intermittent exercise, or increases in intervals.

629
01:00:48,575 --> 01:00:52,679
You also can imagine that if I'm increasing the intensity

630
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:55,962
here, epinephrine is kind of coming out into the bloodstream.

631
01:00:55,962 --> 01:00:59,165
It's really hard to kind of get rid of that, so no surprise.

632
01:00:59,165 --> 01:01:03,369
This kind of matches with the increased epinephrine concentration

633
01:01:03,369 --> 01:01:06,712
and the inability to kind of remove that from the system.

634
01:01:11,217 --> 01:01:15,561
Okay, what about prolonged exercise, right, for increasing duration?

635
01:01:17,785 --> 01:01:20,470
No surprise if I need to supply the muscles with

636
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:25,558
a certain amount of oxygen, cardiac output stays steady as we increase in exercise time.

637
01:01:25,558 --> 01:01:28,764
In this example down on the X axis, we have 90 minutes.

638
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:31,789
So cardiac output is pretty steady.

639
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:38,059
Stroke volume decreases and heart rate starts to increase.

640
01:01:38,059 --> 01:01:43,874
A lot of this is influenced by some sort of thermoregulatory behavior.

641
01:01:43,874 --> 01:01:48,601
If I'm starting to warm up due to the exercise, eventually

642
01:01:48,601 --> 01:01:50,704
the body's going to try to get rid of that heat.

643
01:01:51,525 --> 01:01:57,354
It needs to send blood flow to other areas, which means the stroke volume is going to decrease.

644
01:01:59,137 --> 01:02:01,761
And we compensate by increasing this heart rate.

645
01:02:03,724 --> 01:02:05,787
This is the cardiac drift.

646
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:09,092
So that's this piece here.

647
01:02:11,576 --> 01:02:11,856
Yeah.

648
01:02:16,898 --> 01:02:19,168
Well, so the amount of heat that's being generated from the

649
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:22,744
heart in itself is going to be pretty minor.

650
01:02:22,744 --> 01:02:24,833
But yeah, it would increase more heat.

651
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:30,800
And you also have to think about things like if

652
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:34,844
I'm redistributing blood flow from the leg muscles to the

653
01:02:34,844 --> 01:02:39,029
skin, well, that's less oxygen that we're delivering to the muscles.

654
01:02:39,029 --> 01:02:41,591
It's possible then we're going to get a different type

655
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:45,776
of recruitment and recruit some of those less efficient type 2 fibers.

656
01:02:46,697 --> 01:02:50,821
And so overall, it's kind of a tough process where the

657
01:02:50,821 --> 01:02:54,749
body starts to work a little bit harder, generate more heat.

658
01:02:54,749 --> 01:02:56,611
to lose the heat.

659
01:02:56,611 --> 01:02:59,715
So it becomes a little bit problematic, but we'll talk

660
01:02:59,715 --> 01:03:01,457
more about that when we get to thermal regulation.

661
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:09,987
OK, so this cardiovascular drift here, like what we saw before, heart rate starts to go up.

662
01:03:11,369 --> 01:03:14,512
We kind of maintain this cardiac output.

663
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:18,197
There is a little bit of a decrease to

664
01:03:18,197 --> 01:03:23,723
blood volume, and that's because we're expecting individuals to start to sweat.

665
01:03:23,723 --> 01:03:26,869
And then mean arterial pressure goes down as well as stroke volume.

666
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:39,334
So then how do we think we can prevent cardiovascular drift during prolonged exercise?

667
01:03:44,644 --> 01:03:45,546
Any ideas here?

668
01:03:52,242 --> 01:03:59,330
So if the main reason that we just talked about, if this is some given distance

669
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:04,416
and we are maintaining our pace, but our heart rate does

670
01:04:04,416 --> 01:04:08,080
not just stop at the given heart rate that we would expect

671
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:12,605
for the pace and it starts to increase, we get this cardiovascular drift.

672
01:04:14,367 --> 01:04:17,750
Any ideas how we can try to prevent it?

673
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:21,034
And it's in quotes because it might not be ideal.

674
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:30,365
Yeah, try to maintain some hydration or some other aspects to try to improve thermal regulation.

675
01:04:30,365 --> 01:04:33,230
A lot of this cardiovascular drift is due to the

676
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:36,977
fact that you're trying to maintain perfusion pressure due to

677
01:04:36,977 --> 01:04:40,383
the redistribution of blood flow to the periphery.

678
01:04:42,707 --> 01:04:47,275
Another thing you obviously could do is just slow down.

679
01:04:48,183 --> 01:04:51,309
We don't really want to do that if we're trying to compete.

680
01:04:51,309 --> 01:04:55,035
But if you're out going for a nice little run and you start to see that drift,

681
01:04:55,035 --> 01:04:59,182
well, yeah, if you're trying to reach a certain distance,

682
01:04:59,182 --> 01:05:01,446
it might benefit you from kind of slowing down a little bit.

683
01:05:06,195 --> 01:05:12,787
OK, so during recovery, after you're done exercising, so that's this dotted line here.

684
01:05:12,787 --> 01:05:15,852
No surprise, we see this decrease in heart rate,

685
01:05:15,852 --> 01:05:19,097
stroke volume, and cardiac output going back towards the rest.

686
01:05:20,179 --> 01:05:24,165
Again, how long that takes does depend on a few things,

687
01:05:24,165 --> 01:05:26,829
like intensity of the exercise as well as training state.

688
01:05:28,011 --> 01:05:33,480
We also talked about this recovery piece here as far as oxygen consumption.

689
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,062
So if you remember, that's called EPOC.

690
01:05:35,964 --> 01:05:40,110
So heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output is one piece of that EPOC.

691
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:53,980
Okay, so regulations of cardiovascular adjustments to exercise, we

692
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:56,043
can kind of take big picture here, right?

693
01:05:56,964 --> 01:05:59,988
So exercise requires some sort of ATP.

694
01:06:02,011 --> 01:06:06,958
If you wanted to review that, then we could just be like, well, how do we store ATP?

695
01:06:06,958 --> 01:06:10,363
Well, we have the ready-made ATP, creatine phosphate, we store

696
01:06:10,363 --> 01:06:12,065
it in the form of carbohydrates and fats.

697
01:06:13,587 --> 01:06:15,750
Then sustained exercise,

698
01:06:16,557 --> 01:06:19,083
primarily uses which one of those?

699
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:20,145
We can kind of think about that.

700
01:06:21,248 --> 01:06:24,154
And then what do we need in order to use those energy stores?

701
01:06:24,154 --> 01:06:25,257
Well, we need oxygen.

702
01:06:25,257 --> 01:06:28,544
So then your next question is, well, how do I get oxygen into the body?

703
01:06:28,544 --> 01:06:30,609
And then how do I get it delivered to the muscles?

704
01:06:30,609 --> 01:06:32,794
And you can start going through all those mechanisms.

705
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:38,925
I think this is a pretty good summary of the responses to exercise where

706
01:06:38,925 --> 01:06:44,850
if I'm trying to deliver more blood to the muscles, there

707
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:47,452
are a lot of different factors that are going to get there.

708
01:06:49,795 --> 01:06:53,058
I would be careful with this arrow here, right?

709
01:06:53,978 --> 01:06:58,563
Yes, an increase in cardiac output in most situations

710
01:06:58,563 --> 01:07:02,106
leads to a direct increase in skeletal muscle blood flow.

711
01:07:03,233 --> 01:07:08,118
but not at all exercise intensities and durations, because hopefully

712
01:07:08,118 --> 01:07:12,763
I've shown to you that I can redirect blood flow

713
01:07:12,763 --> 01:07:16,387
due to thermoregulation or even an increase in respiratory rate.

714
01:07:17,848 --> 01:07:22,013
The other pieces down here kind of really help with some

715
01:07:22,013 --> 01:07:28,279
of the, I guess, aspects of control of that cardiac output or the blood flow to the muscles.

716
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:33,363
Are we good there?

717
01:07:35,147 --> 01:07:35,367
OK.

718
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:46,870
So that finishes up this for the cardiovascular piece.

719
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:52,711
Hm.

720
01:07:52,711 --> 01:07:56,741
I do have this set for Thursday, so I think we can stop here.

721
01:07:58,104 --> 01:08:02,074
Keep in mind, I am a little behind on emails.

722
01:08:02,074 --> 01:08:02,996
Some of you may have noticed.

723
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:06,245
So just give me some time and I'll eventually get to those emails.

724
01:08:06,245 --> 01:08:08,290
So thanks for being patient with those.

725
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:09,673
Have a great rest of your day.
