1
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,771
Okay.

2
00:02:11,974 --> 00:02:13,015
Welcome back everyone.

3
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:16,439
Hope you had a good Wednesday.

4
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:23,508
We are going to finish up chapter 11, the acid-base balance during exercise.

5
00:02:23,508 --> 00:02:27,593
And then if we have some time left over, we'll start the physiology of training.

6
00:02:28,454 --> 00:02:35,984
But just a reminder that that will not be part of your second exam.

7
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:37,005
I just realized

8
00:02:38,335 --> 00:02:42,726
I may not have posted those, but that's okay.

9
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:48,671
Okay, so we're gonna do a quick little review of where we ended off.

10
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:53,657
We talked about lines of defense against pH changes during exercise.

11
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:59,884
So if you remember, we had this kind of concept where at the muscles or the tissues

12
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:04,349
that are creating energy through cellular metabolism, we're producing

13
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:11,697
a lot of CO2 that quickly dissociates into carbonic acid and then bicarb and hydrogen ions.

14
00:03:11,697 --> 00:03:16,442
So the production of hydrogen ions from lactate, CO2, and

15
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:22,848
ATP are all going to cause some imbalance in the pH, so a drop in that pH.

16
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:31,256
We typically don't like that to happen, so we have a few lines of defense.

17
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:38,663
We first talked about the first line of defense against the muscle pH changes.

18
00:03:38,663 --> 00:03:43,133
And this first line of defense would be the cellular buffer systems.

19
00:03:44,116 --> 00:03:49,717
So the cellular buffer systems include the bicarb, phosphates, proteins, and cardicene.

20
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:53,384
And we had touched on how carnosine is probably contributing

21
00:03:53,384 --> 00:03:57,751
to the majority of the buffering of the hydrogen ions, so around 60%.

22
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:01,158
Whereas some of the other ones are still extremely

23
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:06,908
important, but maybe the magnitude of contribution for buffering the

24
00:04:06,908 --> 00:04:10,334
pH changes in the muscle cell are not as high.

25
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:13,159
But of course,

26
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:19,193
These cellular buffer mechanisms aren't, or those four are

27
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:23,902
not 100% efficient for like extremely long periods of time.

28
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:26,286
And so eventually you're gonna get an over accumulation of

29
00:04:26,286 --> 00:04:31,516
hydrogen ions inside of the muscle and we need to transport those out of the muscle.

30
00:04:31,516 --> 00:04:34,520
We do those with two separate transporters.

31
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,325
We have a sodium hydrogen exchanger, NHE.

32
00:04:40,306 --> 00:04:44,511
So you're going to bring a sodium in, and that allows for hydrogen to leave.

33
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:48,456
And then we have the monocarboxylate transporter, or the MCT transporter.

34
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:50,859
And this is a symporter.

35
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:54,823
So you're going to move lactate and hydrogen out at the exact same time.

36
00:04:55,624 --> 00:04:58,668
So that's this piece here.

37
00:04:58,668 --> 00:05:04,366
utilize these two transporters in order to decrease these hydrogen ions here.

38
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:08,239
And then that means we kind of see that spillover occur inside of the blood.

39
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:16,869
Okay, then we ended on that slide, and now we need to

40
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:25,000
move over to this other concept here, or the second line of defense against blood pH shifts.

41
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,585
So we'll start with this respiratory compensation for

42
00:05:28,585 --> 00:05:34,814
metabolic acidosis and how that utilizes bicarbs, so the bicarb buffering system.

43
00:05:34,814 --> 00:05:42,082
This one, hopefully, is not too bad because I've shown you this several times now.

44
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:44,245
But it's just this bicarb buffering system here.

45
00:05:46,768 --> 00:05:50,672
In the muscle, we are producing a large amount of CO2

46
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:55,157
that's going to combine with water to make carbonic acid.

47
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:59,114
And then it'll dissociate into bicarb and hydrogen ions.

48
00:05:59,114 --> 00:06:05,282
So it's going to encourage the movement of this system from left to right.

49
00:06:12,592 --> 00:06:19,837
But if we are trying to get rid of all these molecules or decrease the pH,

50
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:24,322
Well, if I'm in a region where the CO2 is low,

51
00:06:24,322 --> 00:06:29,608
the concentration of CO2 is low, then that's gonna push the curve from the right to the left.

52
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:36,356
Where do we typically see some pretty low partial pressures of CO2 in our body?

53
00:06:44,045 --> 00:06:47,970
So what would encourage the reaction to move left?

54
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:53,358
So obviously, if you have too many hydrogen ions, we're going to push it towards the left.

55
00:06:53,358 --> 00:06:57,483
But what would allow for the CO2 to start dropping?

56
00:07:01,628 --> 00:07:02,289
Yeah.

57
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:02,569
Yeah.

58
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:05,714
So the alveoli, if we're bringing in inspiratory air in,

59
00:07:05,714 --> 00:07:10,460
of 0.03% CO2, well, that partial pressure of CO2 is quite low.

60
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,243
And so we can exhale the CO2 out.

61
00:07:13,243 --> 00:07:17,569
And that's going to help continue this curve to shift to the left.

62
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:23,275
And then CO2 is removed by the lungs, eliminating hydrogens and increasing the pH.

63
00:07:28,545 --> 00:07:29,506
Any questions on this?

64
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:34,916
Okay.

65
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:39,625
I know it's kind of rough to just jump straight into it, but let's do it.

66
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,506
Okay, what do we think, maybe 30 more seconds?

67
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:33,089
Does anyone need more time than that?

68
00:09:34,671 --> 00:09:49,853
Okay.

69
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:56,363
All right, 15 seconds.

70
00:09:58,705 --> 00:10:02,129
We'll go five more seconds, double check you have an answer in.

71
00:10:05,853 --> 00:10:10,178
Three, two, one.

72
00:10:16,185 --> 00:10:17,447
Okay, yeah, we did pretty good here.

73
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:21,051
B is the correct answer.

74
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:32,849
So if I have elevated CO2 levels, that's going to push the equilibrium equation to the right.

75
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:39,479
So right away, we're looking at B, D, or E. That's going to cause the creation of more.

76
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:43,465
And if we're looking at these ones over here, it's possible

77
00:10:43,465 --> 00:10:50,636
we can look at maybe D still, as well as E and B. So we're still actually OK.

78
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,241
I could argue that.

79
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:56,043
you would create more carbonic acid.

80
00:10:56,043 --> 00:10:58,506
Although, in general, that quickly dissociates.

81
00:10:58,506 --> 00:11:00,207
So maybe that wouldn't be the best answer.

82
00:11:00,207 --> 00:11:05,313
So you're kind of on B and E, maybe D. And then blood pH.

83
00:11:05,313 --> 00:11:09,077
So if I increase the acidity, whether it's carbonic acid

84
00:11:09,077 --> 00:11:14,383
or hydrogen, that's going to cause the pH to decrease.

85
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,205
So we would want B over here.

86
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:20,029
So the correct answer is B.

87
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:25,955
Yeah.

88
00:11:28,658 --> 00:11:32,222
Oh, yeah, yeah.

89
00:11:32,222 --> 00:11:35,105
So I don't know if I'd give you this equation, but yeah,

90
00:11:35,105 --> 00:11:40,332
you would always assume the CO2 is on the left and then the hydrogen bicarb on the right.

91
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:44,256
Yeah.

92
00:11:44,256 --> 00:11:44,937
Yes.

93
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:51,267
Okay.

94
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:55,483
How about this one then?

95
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,871
All right, let's make sure we have something in.

96
00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:00,034
Double check you have an answer.

97
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:03,138
I'll close this down in like 10 seconds or so.

98
00:14:10,989 --> 00:14:12,270
Let me know if you need more time.

99
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:18,539
Okay, I'll close this down in three, two, one.

100
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:22,785
How do we do?

101
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:27,383
Not too bad.

102
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:33,469
Okay, so we kind of touched on it.

103
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:41,097
If you have a decrease in pH, then you are going to make the blood more acidic.

104
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:44,460
The humoral kind of response that we're looking at,

105
00:14:45,642 --> 00:14:51,402
or those chemoreceptors, are going to detect those changes in pH.

106
00:14:51,402 --> 00:14:58,233
and CO2 that's going to then send signals to the respiratory control center to do something.

107
00:14:59,255 --> 00:15:02,900
Do we want an acidic environment for our body?

108
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:04,944
No, we don't.

109
00:15:04,944 --> 00:15:07,908
And we can't really get rid of it inside of the blood.

110
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:11,013
So the best thing we can do is try to exhale those

111
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:15,080
CO2 molecules so we can drive the reaction to the left.

112
00:15:17,664 --> 00:15:17,764
Good.

113
00:15:18,908 --> 00:15:20,470
And so that's this piece here, right?

114
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,453
So we're gonna drive this down over here.

115
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,801
Any questions on this?

116
00:15:34,427 --> 00:15:34,907
Very nice.

117
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:39,533
Okay, so if we're increasing ventilation to try to blow

118
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:44,899
off excess CO2 production or to try to counterbalance this decrease in pH,

119
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:49,173
We can kind of bring back this concept that you learned

120
00:15:49,173 --> 00:15:53,400
in lab four, where we talk about the ventilatory threshold.

121
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:58,768
So this increase or this change in slope, right?

122
00:15:58,768 --> 00:16:04,336
So if we have the red curve here as ventilation, so

123
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:11,558
we're looking at VE on the y-axis and then intensity and oxygen consumption on the x-axis.

124
00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:15,705
We typically have a linear increase in ventilation, and then

125
00:16:15,705 --> 00:16:18,970
after a certain point in time, we get an exponential increase

126
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,474
or a large change in the slope of ventilation.

127
00:16:22,596 --> 00:16:26,362
This change in slope is caused by an increasing blood

128
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:32,993
PCO2, so a partial pressure of carbon dioxide, as well as the hydrogen ions.

129
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:36,144
We just talked about it.

130
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:39,308
We have that increase in acidity or that decrease in pH, so

131
00:16:39,308 --> 00:16:41,651
we want to get rid of that, so we're going to increase ventilation.

132
00:16:45,536 --> 00:16:49,541
The ventilatory threshold also increases in blood potassium

133
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:56,007
levels or rising temperature, which we kind of touched on last lecture.

134
00:16:56,007 --> 00:17:01,879
Elevated blood catecholamines and possible neural influences may also control with this.

135
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:07,430
So we talked about kind of the neural and the humoral responses to ventilation.

136
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:11,158
So that's what this is talking about.

137
00:17:11,158 --> 00:17:14,505
OK, so it says PCO2 and hydrogen.

138
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:19,801
I did leave something out, and that's lactate.

139
00:17:19,801 --> 00:17:22,845
Do we think lactate concentrations or the production of

140
00:17:22,845 --> 00:17:28,993
lactate or lactic acid then dissociates into lactate and hydrogen ions?

141
00:17:28,993 --> 00:17:32,618
Do we feel like that is contributing to the lactate threshold here?

142
00:17:38,046 --> 00:17:39,027
Maybe, maybe not.

143
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,452
So I'm going to say no, it doesn't.

144
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,265
What support?

145
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,148
do we have for that?

146
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:47,989
Does anyone remember?

147
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:54,077
So if we're looking at lactate or lactate concentration in individuals

148
00:17:54,077 --> 00:17:59,705
who are exercising, what's one condition we talked about where

149
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:02,630
we can start to dissociate the two concepts?

150
00:18:05,994 --> 00:18:11,783
Anyone remember what that's called?

151
00:18:11,783 --> 00:18:12,083
Yep.

152
00:18:14,122 --> 00:18:17,727
Yeah, so in this instance, we're not really going, it

153
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,452
is not related to cramping, but we're not trying to go that route.

154
00:18:21,452 --> 00:18:25,098
I guess I'm trying to say this respiratory compensation or

155
00:18:25,098 --> 00:18:29,464
the increase in slope is primarily due to partial pressure

156
00:18:29,464 --> 00:18:38,897
CO2 and hydrogen ions, but I didn't mention lactate because sometimes, yeah, it is people with McCardles.

157
00:18:40,126 --> 00:18:47,814
the ventilatory threshold still occurs in individuals who do not produce any lactate.

158
00:18:49,616 --> 00:18:55,361
So if you look here, you've seen this before on these dotted or filled in circles,

159
00:18:55,361 --> 00:18:58,184
we have McArdle's patients who are not producing

160
00:18:58,184 --> 00:19:02,689
or changing any lactate concentration here, whereas the controls do

161
00:19:02,689 --> 00:19:06,893
have an increase in lactate, but both McArdle's and

162
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,118
the controls have this ventilatory threshold.

163
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:17,085
So even though they have this respiratory compensation point,

164
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,062
they are not producing any lactate.

165
00:19:21,062 --> 00:19:24,546
So we know the lactate threshold or the ventilatory

166
00:19:24,546 --> 00:19:27,830
threshold is not being caused by the production of lactate.

167
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,993
Instead it is from the partial pressure of CO2 or the

168
00:19:30,993 --> 00:19:38,201
production of CO2 molecules as well as a change in the pH or those hydrogen ion concentrations.

169
00:19:41,024 --> 00:19:42,145
Are we okay with that?

170
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:46,110
And I think you remember the contribution for lactate as

171
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,074
far as hydrogen ions is quite small compared to the other ones.

172
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:57,205
Okay, so let's look at graded exercise in an untrained subject.

173
00:19:57,205 --> 00:20:02,272
You've seen this curve before, but let's go through each and every single one of these.

174
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:09,482
Okay, arterial PO2, or the partial pressure of oxygen in the arteries.

175
00:20:10,762 --> 00:20:16,435
This is maintained quite well between 10 to 12 millimeters

176
00:20:16,435 --> 00:20:23,011
of mercury from the resting value here in untrained individuals.

177
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:25,918
So it stays relatively constant.

178
00:20:30,117 --> 00:20:32,960
Arterial PCO2, or the partial pressure of carbon

179
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,925
dioxide, slightly decreases with maximal exercise.

180
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:39,867
So we see it kind of maintained here.

181
00:20:39,867 --> 00:20:41,229
And then we see this decrease.

182
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,975
And that's due to this kind of change in slope, that ventilatory threshold.

183
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,377
We have that hyperventilation now.

184
00:20:49,377 --> 00:20:52,240
We have these non-metabolically produced CO2 molecules.

185
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,802
We're trying to get rid of them.

186
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:57,406
And so we're getting a little bit of excess hyperventilation

187
00:20:57,406 --> 00:20:59,668
to kind of drive this decrease in PCO2.

188
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:06,279
And then arterial pH, we get a decrease with maximal exercise.

189
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:10,305
We see pH here, pH is here, and then all of a sudden it starts to fall off.

190
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:14,492
And then we just touched on ventilation.

191
00:21:14,492 --> 00:21:17,456
So there's a linear increase up to about 50 to 75%,

192
00:21:17,456 --> 00:21:21,543
and then we get that exponential rise in ventilation.

193
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:26,230
So linear, linear, linear, and then all of a sudden it starts to curl upwards.

194
00:21:31,441 --> 00:21:34,645
Okay, so then we have this other one here, venous PO2.

195
00:21:35,947 --> 00:21:41,554
So the partial pressure of oxygen in the veins or the blood returning back to the heart.

196
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:48,122
Take a couple, like a minute or two, chat with your neighbors.

197
00:21:48,122 --> 00:21:53,749
Why do we think venous partial pressure of oxygen decreases during graded exercise?

198
00:21:53,749 --> 00:21:56,873
So as we start to increase intensity.

199
00:21:57,794 --> 00:21:58,495
All right, go ahead.

200
00:22:52,424 --> 00:22:55,348
OK, this one might be a little bit more straightforward.

201
00:22:55,348 --> 00:22:56,009
What do we think here?

202
00:22:58,073 --> 00:23:01,778
Why do we see the partial pressure of oxygen in the

203
00:23:01,778 --> 00:23:05,624
blood returning back to the heart, the veins, decrease?

204
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:09,690
Any ideas?

205
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:13,834
Yeah, yeah.

206
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:16,538
So your muscles are consuming the oxygen, the

207
00:23:16,538 --> 00:23:20,383
mitochondria in particular, or the electron transport chain, right?

208
00:23:20,383 --> 00:23:24,008
Through that ATP synthase, you're combining oxygen with the hydrogen molecules.

209
00:23:24,008 --> 00:23:24,789
You make some water.

210
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:26,030
Well, that oxygen's gone.

211
00:23:26,831 --> 00:23:29,755
You no longer have that oxygen available.

212
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:33,800
And so the partial pressure drops inside of the muscles.

213
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,326
And that encourages the offloading of oxygen from the

214
00:23:38,326 --> 00:23:41,871
hemoglobin to the myoglobin inside of the muscles.

215
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:43,842
Okay, good.

216
00:23:43,842 --> 00:23:45,403
So that's why we see this decrease here.

217
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:52,109
And if you had the right units here, this value from

218
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:59,536
this value, so the arterial PO2 to the venous PO2, well that's just the AVO2 difference.

219
00:23:59,536 --> 00:24:01,859
So we just know how much is being dropped off here.

220
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:09,085
Then you add in heart rate stroke volume, well that's the Fick equation.

221
00:24:09,085 --> 00:24:10,727
Okay, so another couple,

222
00:24:12,108 --> 00:24:14,001
maybe a minute or so, what about this?

223
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:17,747
Why does arterial pH decrease with maximal exercise?

224
00:26:09,743 --> 00:26:11,165
Okay, what about this one?

225
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:18,137
This one's a little bit, it's not as straightforward, meaning

226
00:26:18,137 --> 00:26:22,003
you have to bring in maybe another concept to try to help this.

227
00:26:22,003 --> 00:26:25,148
I'm gonna see if I can get someone from this side.

228
00:26:28,273 --> 00:26:28,814
What are we thinking?

229
00:26:36,467 --> 00:26:36,747
Yeah?

230
00:26:38,988 --> 00:26:40,490
Good, so I do like that.

231
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,132
Everything you said there was true.

232
00:26:42,132 --> 00:26:46,578
When pH drops, you're shifting the hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right.

233
00:26:46,578 --> 00:26:49,381
That's going to encourage the offloading of tissues.

234
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:54,548
And that might even help some of the partial pressure of O2, the venous O2, to drop.

235
00:26:54,548 --> 00:26:58,633
That's encouraging the offloading of oxygen molecules so the muscles can consume more.

236
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:05,502
But that still doesn't really explain why this is decreasing.

237
00:27:07,034 --> 00:27:11,905
So why is it that arterial pH through certain levels of exercise is maintained?

238
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:17,638
And then even we see an arterial PCO2 decline.

239
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:20,465
And oddly enough, right when that declines, we're seeing

240
00:27:20,465 --> 00:27:23,492
like a pretty substantial decline or the started decline in pH.

241
00:27:24,674 --> 00:27:27,048
When we just talked about this.

242
00:27:27,048 --> 00:27:30,396
If there's an increase in those hydrogen ions, we're going to

243
00:27:30,396 --> 00:27:36,290
try to shift the curve to the left, produce more CO2 to exhale it out.

244
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:40,880
Seems like maybe the PCO2 is going down, but then

245
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,589
that should mean the hydrogen ions should also go down.

246
00:27:44,589 --> 00:27:45,411
Are you going to have a guess?

247
00:27:51,196 --> 00:27:53,199
Yeah, so that is one limitation.

248
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:56,684
So the answer was like, we're kind of capped out.

249
00:27:56,684 --> 00:28:00,309
We were saying, in general, this is like the untrained individuals.

250
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:06,457
Our ventilation is maxed out, and we can't really continue to blow off excess CO2.

251
00:28:06,457 --> 00:28:08,640
So I would agree with that piece.

252
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,864
But then I would also say, if that were the

253
00:28:10,864 --> 00:28:18,314
case, if that explained everything, the decline in partial pressure of CO2 would help

254
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:20,036
Increase pH.

255
00:28:20,036 --> 00:28:22,920
So maybe we wouldn't see as drastic of a drop.

256
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:29,829
So it's in the bicarb buffering equation.

257
00:28:35,357 --> 00:28:37,320
What does hydrogen have to bind to?

258
00:28:43,768 --> 00:28:44,389
Any ideas?

259
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:47,878
Yeah, the bicarb.

260
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:56,912
So you have to have the hydrogen bind to the buffer and then drive the equation over to the left.

261
00:28:56,912 --> 00:29:00,978
We do not have unlimited bicarb inside of our body.

262
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:07,150
If you start buffering these hydrogen ions, eventually you're not going to have

263
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:10,193
the ability to buffer some of these hydrogen ions.

264
00:29:10,193 --> 00:29:13,397
And so you're basically seeing this drop in pH, even

265
00:29:13,397 --> 00:29:19,444
though we have the encouraging drop in PCO2 to drive the equation towards the left.

266
00:29:21,966 --> 00:29:23,268
And so yeah, two big things.

267
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:26,311
The major thing is we lose that buffering capacity.

268
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:28,734
And we can almost assume maybe there's some

269
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:32,898
mechanical limitation in these untrained individuals, where the lungs

270
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:36,262
might be not ventilating as much out.

271
00:29:36,262 --> 00:29:37,123
So I like those two.

272
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,584
Okay, so then this last piece, this one's pretty straightforward.

273
00:29:43,584 --> 00:29:45,607
I don't think we need to touch on it because one

274
00:29:45,607 --> 00:29:50,214
of your classmates did kind of mention this, but why does arterial PCO2 decrease here?

275
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,942
Who wants to help me out with this one?

276
00:29:58,225 --> 00:30:00,208
What's causing the decrease in PCO2?

277
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,389
It's definitely not the hydrogen ions.

278
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:07,755
The hydrogen ions are going up.

279
00:30:07,755 --> 00:30:12,354
If anything, it's going to drive it over to the left, and we're going to have an increase in PCO2.

280
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:14,282
Why do we see this drop in PCO2?

281
00:30:21,468 --> 00:30:23,191
Yeah, you're just exhaling more CO2.

282
00:30:23,191 --> 00:30:27,798
You have that respiratory compensation point like both your classmates mentioned.

283
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:31,625
You have that hyperventilation, and so you're blowing off excess CO2.

284
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:36,713
Maybe it's not enough to really make a big difference in the arterial pH.

285
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:43,003
But again, we're seeing this drop here, drop here because we're losing the buffering capacity.

286
00:30:49,025 --> 00:30:56,233
So you're all seniors, smart individuals, you're gonna soon become some entrepreneurs, right?

287
00:30:56,233 --> 00:31:02,619
So if you're seeing this and you just heard this, what do you think might be the next step?

288
00:31:02,619 --> 00:31:04,041
This is a problem in performance.

289
00:31:06,403 --> 00:31:08,686
What do you think one could suggest?

290
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,409
Yeah, some type of buffer, right?

291
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:17,395
So then let me ask you, if that's what you're thinking about,

292
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:25,073
Could the ingestion of a buffer improve short-term high-intensity exercise performance?

293
00:32:07,308 --> 00:32:10,051
Okay, let's go another 30 seconds or so on this one.

294
00:32:29,376 --> 00:32:35,323
Okay, maybe 10 more seconds from now, unless anyone needs more time.

295
00:32:38,341 --> 00:32:39,903
All right, we'll close it down in five.

296
00:32:39,903 --> 00:32:44,871
Three, two, one.

297
00:32:52,443 --> 00:32:53,766
So we're like 50-50 here.

298
00:32:58,133 --> 00:33:04,703
So first, how do you think one can get ahold of BiCard?

299
00:33:08,699 --> 00:33:13,413
It is readily available at your nearest grocery store.

300
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:15,680
Any ideas?

301
00:33:16,944 --> 00:33:18,308
Yeah.

302
00:33:18,308 --> 00:33:22,874
You can go and you can get some baking soda.

303
00:33:22,874 --> 00:33:24,596
You probably shouldn't go that route.

304
00:33:24,596 --> 00:33:26,257
But you can also do sodium citrate.

305
00:33:26,257 --> 00:33:29,881
And I'm not recommending this at all because we'll talk about some downsides here.

306
00:33:29,881 --> 00:33:32,043
But this would make sense, right?

307
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:35,687
If I could get more bicarb in my body, well, then

308
00:33:35,687 --> 00:33:38,089
they're going to accept some of those hydrogen ions.

309
00:33:38,089 --> 00:33:40,812
And then we can drive the equation this way.

310
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:44,616
And we can help blow off some excess CO2 to

311
00:33:44,616 --> 00:33:52,003
decrease the acidity or change the acidity and decrease the number of hydrogen ions.

312
00:33:54,211 --> 00:33:57,955
But then we saw about 50-50 here.

313
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,520
Does it improve performance, does it not?

314
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,963
So we need to be a little bit careful with this, right?

315
00:34:03,963 --> 00:34:08,848
Some studies showed improvement in performance with ingestion of buffers.

316
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,471
They found that it can increase the time

317
00:34:11,471 --> 00:34:16,658
to exhaustion during high-intensity exercise, and individuals appear

318
00:34:16,658 --> 00:34:18,440
to maybe recover a little bit faster.

319
00:34:19,501 --> 00:34:23,202
Whereas other studies show no improvement.

320
00:34:23,202 --> 00:34:28,672
So I don't know if, well, we'll get to the no improvement here in a second,

321
00:34:28,672 --> 00:34:33,541
but if we're looking at blood bicarb concentration here

322
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:38,190
and then blood hydrogen concentration, the control is in blue.

323
00:34:39,098 --> 00:34:40,759
on this side and that side.

324
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,584
And then the bicarb concentration, it looks like they infused

325
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:52,710
it into the blood and it worked quite well, meaning the concentration of buffer or the bicarb did go up.

326
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,932
And it looks like it was able to decrease the

327
00:34:55,932 --> 00:35:01,157
hydrogen ion concentration across exercise as well as recovery.

328
00:35:02,899 --> 00:35:08,143
Now, maybe the 50%, 60% of you know, but like,

329
00:35:09,912 --> 00:35:11,936
Why don't you think it might not work?

330
00:35:17,026 --> 00:35:19,651
Has anyone tried this?

331
00:35:22,337 --> 00:35:25,423
What do you think would happen if you ingested a decent amount of bicarb?

332
00:35:26,568 --> 00:35:30,917
Has anyone done those little volcano experiments when you're younger?

333
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,048
So then when I say that, you're like, OK, maybe that's not a good idea.

334
00:35:36,048 --> 00:35:40,136
So yes, they have different methods of trying to get it in.

335
00:35:40,136 --> 00:35:41,399
But we need to be careful.

336
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:47,645
It can definitely cause some nausea and vomiting, especially with sodium bicarbonate.

337
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:51,312
Large doses are also problematic.

338
00:35:51,312 --> 00:35:55,360
If you consume too much bicarb, because ideally, you would

339
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,048
be doing it before exercise, not as you're exercising.

340
00:35:59,048 --> 00:36:02,034
So if you consume too much, that could change the

341
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,759
pH in the opposite direction while you're at rest.

342
00:36:07,355 --> 00:36:10,319
And another consideration would be maybe it's banned.

343
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:16,266
So there was a period in time where a lot of athletes were actually consuming baking soda

344
00:36:16,266 --> 00:36:19,029
or sodium citrate, and they were trying to get some of

345
00:36:19,029 --> 00:36:23,114
this bicarbonate out of their body as a performance enhancement.

346
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,778
But it causes a lot of GI distress.

347
00:36:25,778 --> 00:36:30,363
It's very uncomfortable, and we don't really know how much gets absorbed.

348
00:36:30,363 --> 00:36:34,088
Because the previous study I showed you, they just infused it into the blood.

349
00:36:35,215 --> 00:36:39,643
So that definitely has been shown to be quite effective.

350
00:36:40,544 --> 00:36:47,998
But again, consult your sports regulation agency to see if you can use bicarb.

351
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:50,963
I know WADA, I think, it might be on that list.

352
00:36:52,748 --> 00:36:55,593
OK, so that would be bicarb.

353
00:36:55,593 --> 00:36:58,458
So we definitely know that has a buffering capacity.

354
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:02,985
Does anyone else know of a supplement that is

355
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:06,952
still relatively popular, especially amongst maybe resistance training

356
00:37:06,952 --> 00:37:12,581
individuals that is usually added to maybe a pre-workout mix?

357
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:17,710
Yeah.

358
00:37:18,753 --> 00:37:21,216
Creatine is one of them, and usually it is with

359
00:37:21,216 --> 00:37:25,922
creatine, and so creatine's definitely gonna help with your immediate energy store.

360
00:37:27,284 --> 00:37:28,966
Beta alanine, yeah.

361
00:37:30,068 --> 00:37:31,610
Has anyone heard of this beta alanine?

362
00:37:33,152 --> 00:37:36,716
Like sometimes people consume these beta alanine drinks, and

363
00:37:36,716 --> 00:37:41,222
they get like a little tingly feeling, and they're like, oh man, I'm ready to go now, right?

364
00:37:41,222 --> 00:37:47,410
So beta alanine is an important precursor to carnosine.

365
00:37:48,993 --> 00:37:50,595
Wait, where have you heard carnosine?

366
00:37:54,421 --> 00:37:54,741
Say again.

367
00:37:55,563 --> 00:38:01,732
First line of defense, it's a chemical buffer that is really helping with muscular pH defense.

368
00:38:02,773 --> 00:38:06,374
So beta alanine is going to help increase

369
00:38:06,374 --> 00:38:10,239
the ability to create those carnosine buffers.

370
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:14,786
Well, that's nice, because carnosine buffers about 60% inside of the muscle.

371
00:38:14,786 --> 00:38:20,293
So it's kind of the primary buffering substance that we have inside of our muscle.

372
00:38:21,275 --> 00:38:25,361
And so they've done a lot of studies, not as much

373
00:38:25,361 --> 00:38:28,084
recently, because as soon as this came out, this was on the craze.

374
00:38:28,084 --> 00:38:31,289
So everyone was like beta-alanine human performance.

375
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:35,180
But it's a non-essential amino acid that's produced in the liver.

376
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,831
relatively low levels in the blood, but it is an important precursor to carnosine.

377
00:38:40,894 --> 00:38:45,946
And supplementation and the research that kind of has been provided suggests

378
00:38:45,946 --> 00:38:48,893
that there is an improvement in performance, especially

379
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:51,599
with the short duration high intensity exercise.

380
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,744
So obviously not that big of a deal for these

381
00:38:55,744 --> 00:39:00,589
kind of longer duration submaximal exercise, because again, we're

382
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:03,233
not seeing these large disturbances in pH.

383
00:39:03,233 --> 00:39:06,596
But ideally, maybe towards the end of an exercise.

384
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:10,301
But what hasn't been shown is after two hours, do

385
00:39:10,301 --> 00:39:16,128
you still maintain the high levels of the cardicine after beta-alanine supplementation?

386
00:39:16,128 --> 00:39:20,557
So really, the majority of the evidence is supporting

387
00:39:20,557 --> 00:39:26,007
kind of the short term or short duration high intensity exercise with beta-alanine.

388
00:39:29,394 --> 00:39:31,938
Okay.

389
00:39:31,938 --> 00:39:33,201
Oh, man.

390
00:39:33,201 --> 00:39:34,363
I gave this one away.

391
00:39:34,363 --> 00:39:37,208
But I'm just going to have to put it on the exam now.

392
00:39:38,771 --> 00:39:43,881
Which proposed mechanism would beta-alanine directly improve to potentially enhance performance?

393
00:40:22,758 --> 00:40:24,862
Important word here is directly improves.

394
00:40:24,862 --> 00:40:34,523
Where is beta-alanine directly impacting in the pieces that we've talked about so far?

395
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:14,726
Okay, we'll go five more seconds unless someone needs more time.

396
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,453
It's not as close as I thought it was gonna be.

397
00:41:19,453 --> 00:41:22,317
I'll close this down here.

398
00:41:23,799 --> 00:41:26,643
And three, two, one.

399
00:41:31,671 --> 00:41:34,615
Okay, so the correct answer is D here.

400
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:44,168
So if you remember, the cellular buffer system has carnosine over here,

401
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,770
whereas the blood buffering, we're really kind of

402
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:51,796
relying on the respiratory compensation, bicarb, the phosphates and proteins over here.

403
00:41:59,464 --> 00:41:59,724
OK.

404
00:42:00,805 --> 00:42:02,847
So if we shown, yeah.

405
00:42:06,185 --> 00:42:09,863
You could, but it's actually a little bit harder to consume those and manufacture them.

406
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:11,833
Yeah, yeah.

407
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:13,039
That's a good idea.

408
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:13,883
And you can, though.

409
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:18,192
This one is just a little bit easier.

410
00:42:18,192 --> 00:42:21,476
All right, supplementation suggests that it does improve performance.

411
00:42:21,476 --> 00:42:24,519
So if you're like, oh, man, I'm going to the gym, and

412
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:27,683
I'm going to have a great workout, how much do I need?

413
00:42:27,683 --> 00:42:31,067
You don't need a whole lot, two to three grams per day.

414
00:42:31,067 --> 00:42:33,630
It does improve the muscle's buffering capacity.

415
00:42:34,491 --> 00:42:38,415
And it's really only going to be inside of that one to

416
00:42:38,415 --> 00:42:44,542
four minutes, as far as kind of this high intensity exercise.

417
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:47,786
There's some evidence that suggests that if there

418
00:42:47,786 --> 00:42:52,452
is a well-trained individual, typically we've already kind of

419
00:42:53,273 --> 00:42:58,219
maximized the amount of carnosine that we can have inside of our muscles.

420
00:42:58,219 --> 00:43:02,284
So it may not improve for well-trained individuals, but

421
00:43:02,284 --> 00:43:06,229
there are some individuals who still improve who are kind of

422
00:43:06,229 --> 00:43:11,221
on that elite, sub-elite category as far as the lower intensity.

423
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:15,289
Definitely, if you do decide to do it or you

424
00:43:15,289 --> 00:43:18,414
are recommending it to anybody, they would probably want to try

425
00:43:18,414 --> 00:43:21,680
it in training and then apply it before a race.

426
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,485
I would never try something brand new before an event.

427
00:43:24,485 --> 00:43:27,491
But it seems like all you need is two to three grams

428
00:43:27,491 --> 00:43:34,644
per day to get a pretty decent improvement in the buffering capacity of the muscles.

429
00:43:34,644 --> 00:43:35,085
Yeah.

430
00:43:37,394 --> 00:43:40,038
Well, a lot of times, it happens to be associate.

431
00:43:40,038 --> 00:43:43,162
Like, the manufacturers put a lot of those things inside.

432
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:48,269
So then you're like, oh, man, it's going to work.

433
00:43:48,269 --> 00:43:48,389
Yeah.

434
00:43:48,389 --> 00:43:48,509
Yeah.

435
00:43:48,509 --> 00:43:49,771
I mean, they sold a lot of stuff.

436
00:43:49,771 --> 00:43:54,898
So it kind of, like, from a selling standpoint, it worked quite well.

437
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:55,779
All right.

438
00:43:55,779 --> 00:43:56,961
So maybe you're like, no way.

439
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,464
Everything's too expensive.

440
00:43:59,464 --> 00:44:03,630
Inflation, I don't want to spend money on beta alanine.

441
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:06,065
What else do you think?

442
00:44:06,065 --> 00:44:08,371
could help before exercise.

443
00:44:10,316 --> 00:44:15,028
One of those things might be one of the things we just talked about.

444
00:44:16,812 --> 00:44:22,386
So could hyperventilation before short-term high-intensity exercise improve performance?

445
00:44:59,862 --> 00:45:09,872
All right.

446
00:45:11,053 --> 00:45:13,876
Just take about 15 more seconds, double check you have an answer in.

447
00:45:13,876 --> 00:45:15,418
We're missing a handful of clickers.

448
00:45:23,406 --> 00:45:25,448
I think we're missing two clickers.

449
00:45:27,031 --> 00:45:31,938
All right, I'll close this down in three, two, one.

450
00:45:36,323 --> 00:45:39,127
Okay, so 60-40 split, right?

451
00:45:39,127 --> 00:45:43,453
Man, I've never, it's like right on 60-40, I like it.

452
00:45:43,453 --> 00:45:46,677
60-40 split here, we're saying some people yes, some people no.

453
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:52,136
Well, from what we kind of talked about, maybe we

454
00:45:52,136 --> 00:45:55,242
need to be careful about what kind of hyperventilation, right?

455
00:45:55,242 --> 00:45:58,028
We don't want to just do increasing frequency, because

456
00:45:58,028 --> 00:46:01,815
then we're just exchanging dead space, so maybe those kind of deep breaths in.

457
00:46:01,815 --> 00:46:09,190
That will kind of decrease the CO2, and it's going to drive the reaction to the left.

458
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:11,817
And so it will.

459
00:46:11,817 --> 00:46:17,925
At least from a blood standpoint, we're going to increase the partial pressure of oxygen.

460
00:46:17,925 --> 00:46:20,489
But we don't really care about that too much

461
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:24,394
in this instance, because we're talking about short-term high-intensity exercise.

462
00:46:24,394 --> 00:46:26,517
Plus, you're already at 100% saturation.

463
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:27,358
Not that big of a deal.

464
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:30,843
But here's where we're trying to see if it works.

465
00:46:30,843 --> 00:46:36,311
And so yeah, hyperventilation does decrease the partial pressure of CO2.

466
00:46:37,332 --> 00:46:41,638
So then in theory, if you decrease the partial pressure of CO2 in blood,

467
00:46:42,698 --> 00:46:46,543
we would need to see then does that relate to performance?

468
00:46:46,543 --> 00:46:52,372
And so there is a pretty interesting study done with repeated or interval exercises

469
00:46:52,372 --> 00:46:56,618
and hyperventilation implemented during recovery intervals of

470
00:46:56,618 --> 00:47:00,383
repeated sprinting did attenuate performance decrements, meaning

471
00:47:00,383 --> 00:47:04,088
it improved performance in subsequent exercise bouts.

472
00:47:05,831 --> 00:47:08,551
So that's pretty cool because

473
00:47:08,551 --> 00:47:10,595
From a broad concept, yeah, that makes sense.

474
00:47:10,595 --> 00:47:14,381
If I hyperventilate enough to drop my PCO2, that should

475
00:47:14,381 --> 00:47:22,335
encourage the ability for my body to maybe defend against drops in pH for a little bit longer.

476
00:47:22,335 --> 00:47:25,120
Or if I did have that drop in pH, well, maybe

477
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:32,213
I can increase the hyperventilation to try to get those hydrogen molecules to leave the body.

478
00:47:33,627 --> 00:47:37,355
Now, this is the one where you definitely want to try

479
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:41,604
this in a safe space with some friends before implementing it, right?

480
00:47:41,604 --> 00:47:45,473
If you start hyperventilating before start line, you got all

481
00:47:45,473 --> 00:47:48,680
things going on, and you pass out, that's not on me.

482
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,721
that's on you, right?

483
00:47:49,721 --> 00:47:54,748
So you definitely want to practice this if you're really like, oh, I'm going to do it.

484
00:47:54,748 --> 00:47:58,994
And you'll kind of notice on some of the sprints, like the shorter distance sprints,

485
00:47:58,994 --> 00:48:01,958
100 meter Olympics, you'll see some of the athletes kind

486
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:04,241
of doing this when they're down into the blocks.

487
00:48:04,241 --> 00:48:11,211
But it is interesting to see that it potentially could help out with the buffering capacity.

488
00:48:12,187 --> 00:48:17,095
And we'll touch on this once we get to thermoregulation.

489
00:48:17,095 --> 00:48:22,103
But there's a very polarizing character who came up

490
00:48:22,103 --> 00:48:29,135
with alternative breathing techniques to try to maybe implement this as well as some other things.

491
00:48:29,135 --> 00:48:32,700
But has anyone heard of that individual, that breathing technique?

492
00:48:35,224 --> 00:48:37,288
All right, we'll get to that in thermoreg.

493
00:48:37,288 --> 00:48:38,650
But anyways.

494
00:48:40,503 --> 00:48:44,308
Okay, so let's move on then because the lungs are great,

495
00:48:44,308 --> 00:48:49,033
bicarb are great, but we need to know where this bicarb comes from.

496
00:48:49,033 --> 00:48:52,137
So the regulation of acid-base balance via the kidneys.

497
00:48:55,261 --> 00:49:03,511
So kidneys are extremely important, but they're more important in the long-term acid-base balance.

498
00:49:05,874 --> 00:49:09,278
Not a really significant contribution during exercise.

499
00:49:12,076 --> 00:49:15,161
So at rest, the kidneys can contribute to this

500
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:20,289
acid-base balance by regulating the bicarb concentration.

501
00:49:23,674 --> 00:49:29,343
And this does, or the kidneys do this by regulating how much bicarb they excrete.

502
00:49:30,545 --> 00:49:33,450
And this is where we get into the little bit of a problem where individuals,

503
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:36,294
if they consume some bicarb and they don't consume enough

504
00:49:36,294 --> 00:49:39,940
of it, well, the kidneys are just gonna excrete it over a certain period of time.

505
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:48,041
But during exercise, if we're controlling bicarb excretion, why

506
00:49:48,041 --> 00:49:51,606
is it during exercise we're not seeing a significant difference

507
00:49:51,606 --> 00:49:57,614
or maybe a significant benefit with the kidneys and bicarb?

508
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:01,941
Yeah, yeah.

509
00:50:01,941 --> 00:50:05,366
So the blood flow in the kidneys are already really low.

510
00:50:05,366 --> 00:50:12,556
And so if it's trying to grab some bicarb in the first place or more, well,

511
00:50:12,556 --> 00:50:15,321
there's very little even going through the kidneys in the first place.

512
00:50:15,321 --> 00:50:21,832
So during exercise, usually the kidneys have very little regulation of our bicarb concentration.

513
00:50:21,832 --> 00:50:25,358
It's more at rest when we have a little bit of a higher blood flow in the kidneys.

514
00:50:28,764 --> 00:50:29,725
Good, good, good.

515
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:36,657
Okay, regulation of acid-base balance after exercise.

516
00:50:37,885 --> 00:50:40,672
So you've kind of gone through this high intensity exercise.

517
00:50:40,672 --> 00:50:42,416
You have all these hydrogen ions.

518
00:50:42,416 --> 00:50:44,180
Your acidity is really high.

519
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,085
The pH is really low.

520
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:49,453
How can we try to return back to normal?

521
00:50:50,796 --> 00:50:55,928
Well, we have some recent evidence that we have some lactic acid that's oxidized.

522
00:50:56,853 --> 00:51:04,642
So in order to try to get it back to pyruvate, well, now lactate is a hydrogen acceptor.

523
00:51:04,642 --> 00:51:07,505
You need to combine it with the hydrogen to get it

524
00:51:07,505 --> 00:51:10,869
back to the pyruvate so then you can then convert it back to glucose.

525
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:15,974
So that's a decent amount, and we do that through the Cori cycle.

526
00:51:17,716 --> 00:51:25,425
And then the majority of the other lactate molecules are then converted to amino acids.

527
00:51:27,447 --> 00:51:29,029
So there is this recovery piece.

528
00:51:29,029 --> 00:51:31,632
Yeah, you're going to continue to exhale some of those

529
00:51:33,074 --> 00:51:38,481
carbon dioxide molecules as well as kind of move the hydrogens over.

530
00:51:38,481 --> 00:51:43,547
But you also are going to reconvert some of the lactate molecules.

531
00:51:43,547 --> 00:51:46,210
So even though it's a smaller amount, that's OK.

532
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:49,354
It's still contributing a little bit after exercise.

533
00:51:52,658 --> 00:51:56,762
One thing to note though is following strenuous exercise,

534
00:51:57,583 --> 00:52:02,949
lactic acid is removed more rapidly with light exercise during recovery.

535
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:07,694
So if someone went through this really intense high intensity exercise

536
00:52:07,694 --> 00:52:10,897
and then they just rested, well blood lactate levels

537
00:52:10,897 --> 00:52:18,025
are more elevated compared to light exercise and we're talking like 30, 35% VO2 max.

538
00:52:19,287 --> 00:52:22,851
then we see a decrease in the lactate concentration.

539
00:52:24,132 --> 00:52:29,619
What would be the problem of doing maybe a moderate to higher intensity exercise for recovery?

540
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:38,408
So why does it have to be this lower intensity exercise?

541
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:40,611
One, why does it work?

542
00:52:40,611 --> 00:52:44,215
And two, why couldn't we do moderate to high intensity exercise?

543
00:52:48,616 --> 00:52:53,224
Any ideas to that?

544
00:52:53,224 --> 00:52:56,810
Yeah, if I just do high intensity exercise, I'm producing more lactate.

545
00:52:56,810 --> 00:53:02,640
So that should not be the route to maybe clear some of this and anything.

546
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,424
Lactate just happens to be a marker that we can easily see.

547
00:53:06,566 --> 00:53:13,678
Then number two, why would light exercise work then?

548
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,877
Yeah, you're increasing blood flow.

549
00:53:17,877 --> 00:53:19,780
And if you increase blood flow at this light

550
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,824
intensity exercise, well, you're increasing blood flow to the liver.

551
00:53:23,645 --> 00:53:25,708
And so you're able to maybe clear some things a

552
00:53:25,708 --> 00:53:31,676
little bit faster at light intensity exercise versus no exercise.

553
00:53:32,477 --> 00:53:34,920
And definitely better than high intensity exercise, because

554
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,344
now you're reducing blood flow to these important areas.

555
00:53:39,026 --> 00:53:41,269
And then on top of that, you're producing more hydrogen ions.

556
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:47,152
So optimal intensity, where we're looking at maybe 30,

557
00:53:47,152 --> 00:53:53,941
35% is going to potentially increase blood flow, which is also

558
00:53:53,941 --> 00:53:59,308
good if you're trying to deal with maybe inflammation or other types of things to clear.

559
00:54:01,891 --> 00:54:03,033
So then same deal.

560
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:09,501
It's like, well, if this concept is based on increasing blood flow to get it back to the heart,

561
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:17,316
What are some things that have been made available

562
00:54:17,316 --> 00:54:22,885
for purchase that may help encourage this without exercise, or maybe during exercise?

563
00:54:23,846 --> 00:54:24,447
Any ideas?

564
00:54:29,715 --> 00:54:33,000
Maybe less common now, but maybe sort of happens a lot.

565
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,717
But has anyone heard of compression socks?

566
00:54:36,717 --> 00:54:44,087
Yeah, so we don't have to answer this one, but compression wear improves recovery after exercise.

567
00:54:44,087 --> 00:54:49,675
I'm not gonna run this clicker, so don't worry about that, but in theory, what do you think?

568
00:54:50,877 --> 00:54:52,239
Who can help me out here?

569
00:54:54,402 --> 00:54:55,263
Do you think this would work?

570
00:54:57,406 --> 00:54:59,148
Recovery after exercise?

571
00:55:02,994 --> 00:55:05,357
Maybe, yes, no, should I run the clicker instead?

572
00:55:06,974 --> 00:55:08,358
So you're saying yes?

573
00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:09,281
Or you're saying run the clicker?

574
00:55:10,084 --> 00:55:10,966
Run the clicker?

575
00:55:10,966 --> 00:55:11,749
OK.

576
00:55:11,749 --> 00:55:12,852
Let me just see what we're thinking.

577
00:55:17,546 --> 00:55:17,827
All right.

578
00:55:17,827 --> 00:55:21,338
Can compression wear improve recovery after exercise?

579
00:55:34,683 --> 00:55:54,690
Let's go like 15 more seconds here.

580
00:55:56,713 --> 00:55:58,075
Double check you have something in.

581
00:56:00,265 --> 00:56:15,827
All right, I'll close it down in three, two, one.

582
00:56:18,777 --> 00:56:21,782
Yeah, most of you are saying yes, and I'd have to agree with you, right?

583
00:56:21,782 --> 00:56:25,909
Like if the whole purpose is that if I'm standing up or

584
00:56:25,909 --> 00:56:31,578
if I have blood pooling down inside of my leg muscles or

585
00:56:31,578 --> 00:56:39,611
the leg, it could help me kind of redirect blood flow to the,

586
00:56:39,611 --> 00:56:44,495
I don't know, to the central of your body and get it back to your heart.

587
00:56:44,495 --> 00:56:46,364
Here's a review question.

588
00:56:46,364 --> 00:56:52,412
By what mechanism are we working on this increase in end-diastolic volume?

589
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,172
the skeletal muscle pump, right?

590
00:56:57,172 --> 00:57:02,437
You are literally just squeezing on the veins and encouraging blood to go back up.

591
00:57:02,437 --> 00:57:08,023
So you're kind of working on that principle to get the blood back to the heart.

592
00:57:08,023 --> 00:57:11,047
If you increase end-diastolic volume, you're gonna increase stroke

593
00:57:11,047 --> 00:57:14,510
volume, and so then you're kind of increasing blood flow a little bit more passively.

594
00:57:15,571 --> 00:57:17,193
And so that's why sometimes you'll see a lot of

595
00:57:17,193 --> 00:57:24,218
compression wear, but if you look at this individual, this individual's running with compression wear.

596
00:57:24,218 --> 00:57:28,704
So then the next question probably is, well, what about during running performance?

597
00:57:30,206 --> 00:57:34,492
Well, if we think about that same principle that it's

598
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:41,442
kind of compressing on the veins, well, your muscles are doing a better job than the compression wear.

599
00:57:41,442 --> 00:57:46,669
And so you can't close a vein more than you already are closing it.

600
00:57:46,669 --> 00:57:54,256
And so we can see that control low, medium, and high compression has no bearing on performance.

601
00:57:54,256 --> 00:57:57,760
And so it might be comfortable for the individual or

602
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,644
might make an individual feel better or whatever it happens to be.

603
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:05,889
But as far as a kind of improvement in performance,

604
00:58:05,889 --> 00:58:09,012
it's not really doing anything for those individuals.

605
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:14,879
But as I mentioned, after performance, we are seeing a

606
00:58:14,879 --> 00:58:19,183
little bit of a benefit because it's encouraging the blood flow to increase.

607
00:58:23,168 --> 00:58:24,229
OK.

608
00:58:25,812 --> 00:58:29,837
Compression wear, maybe that's not doing as good of a

609
00:58:29,837 --> 00:58:33,983
job because it's just applying a certain amount of compression and that's it.

610
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:37,768
What do you think you could design or what have you

611
00:58:37,768 --> 00:58:43,195
seen maybe out there that can maybe simulate muscular contractions even better?

612
00:58:45,318 --> 00:58:46,360
Yeah, wait, say it again.

613
00:58:47,201 --> 00:58:48,623
Yeah, yeastim actually would work.

614
00:58:49,664 --> 00:58:50,525
Anything else?

615
00:58:50,525 --> 00:58:52,528
I'm only looking at you because you probably have used it.

616
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:56,564
Yeah, compression boots or compression wear.

617
00:58:56,564 --> 00:58:59,968
So has anyone heard of Normatec?

618
00:59:01,549 --> 00:59:06,175
So they actually designed some of these where they

619
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:11,020
would begin compression down towards the feet and then slowly

620
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:16,467
compress to encourage the movement of blood flow from the bottom

621
00:59:16,467 --> 00:59:19,230
of your feet all the way up back towards your heart.

622
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:21,132
And so it'll kind of

623
00:59:22,613 --> 00:59:25,517
add that compression, then let it all go so you can

624
00:59:25,517 --> 00:59:30,663
get it to refill, and then add the compression down and push the blood all the way up.

625
00:59:30,663 --> 00:59:33,928
I think these are, this is kind of an outdated price, but

626
00:59:33,928 --> 00:59:38,273
if you're like, yes, I'm going to go and get some, they are pretty expensive to get.

627
00:59:38,273 --> 00:59:43,660
But sometimes you'll see it, like, they'll have, or they used to have booths after, like,

628
00:59:45,817 --> 00:59:48,441
what do you call it, the Boulder Boulder, the 10K over here.

629
00:59:48,441 --> 00:59:51,325
So they'll just have people and you can go and try them out and things like that.

630
00:59:51,325 --> 00:59:55,230
But from principle, it actually works quite well.

631
00:59:55,230 --> 01:00:01,459
But like all things, moderation is key.

632
01:00:01,459 --> 01:00:02,981
Too much is also not good.

633
01:00:06,746 --> 01:00:07,988
Any questions so far?

634
01:00:11,432 --> 01:00:11,993
OK.

635
01:00:13,036 --> 01:00:18,462
That then concludes all of the material up till the second exam.

636
01:00:18,462 --> 01:00:20,745
So again, chapters eight through 11.

637
01:00:20,745 --> 01:00:25,150
So from skeletal muscle all the way till what we talked about right now.

638
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:31,498
It's gonna be 30 around, it'll be 33 multiple choice questions because you did get one bonus.

639
01:00:32,499 --> 01:00:36,524
Use the lecture notes, learning goals, and in class worksheets to study.

640
01:00:36,524 --> 01:00:40,208
The worksheets are just the things that you fill out on the tables, that might help.

641
01:00:42,044 --> 01:00:47,356
So you will not see these large equations or big calculations to do.

642
01:00:48,178 --> 01:00:52,307
But you can imagine, even if it's a simple calculation, you might want to rely on a calculator.

643
01:00:52,307 --> 01:00:53,249
That's why that's there.

644
01:00:55,113 --> 01:00:57,800
And then just make sure you know your ID.

645
01:00:58,842 --> 01:01:01,588
If there's a formula or a conversion needed, I'll give that to you.

646
01:01:09,449 --> 01:01:12,273
Yeah, I'd give that to you, but you still need to, if

647
01:01:12,273 --> 01:01:15,098
I tell you to calculate cardiac output and I give you a

648
01:01:15,098 --> 01:01:19,705
heart rate and a stroke volume, you gotta type that in yourself.

649
01:01:19,705 --> 01:01:24,372
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

650
01:01:24,372 --> 01:01:29,801
Okay, well, I'm okay with calling it a day here.

651
01:01:30,762 --> 01:01:35,049
Enjoy, we'll start on Tuesday, we'll start with physiology of training though.

652
01:01:35,049 --> 01:01:35,710
Have a good one.
