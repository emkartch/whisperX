1
00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:51,570
Thank you.

2
00:02:56,763 --> 00:02:59,275
Okay, let's get started.

3
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:05,727
Welcome back, everyone.

4
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:12,540
So we're gonna finish up chapter six, exercise in the immune system.

5
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:18,187
So this is the last slide deck that will be on your exam this Thursday.

6
00:03:18,187 --> 00:03:22,112
At the end of this, I'll give some more details on the

7
00:03:22,112 --> 00:03:29,260
exam as well as we'll have plenty of time for some questions if you have any.

8
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,363
So like review type questions.

9
00:03:31,363 --> 00:03:35,508
I'll even have a few clicker questions that might be

10
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:39,512
more closely worded to how the exam might be worded and

11
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:44,258
potentially at a little bit of a closer difficulty level

12
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:46,560
compared to some of the previous clicker questions we've had.

13
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:53,768
So if you have any questions about the exam, we'll go over that towards the end of lecture.

14
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,312
Sound okay?

15
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,533
All right.

16
00:03:58,954 --> 00:04:04,080
So we left off on this concept of the J-curve

17
00:04:04,904 --> 00:04:08,168
And this is basically just giving us an idea if we

18
00:04:08,168 --> 00:04:11,552
have a risk for an upper respiratory tract infection.

19
00:04:12,914 --> 00:04:18,962
No exercise or being sedentary will put us at the normal baseline risk.

20
00:04:18,962 --> 00:04:22,566
And even though we're depressing this, this is a decrease

21
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:27,893
in the risk of experiencing an upper respiratory tract infection

22
00:04:28,774 --> 00:04:32,377
if you have some sort of moderate exercise activity.

23
00:04:32,377 --> 00:04:36,586
And then as you get into heavier exertion, then that

24
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:39,151
becomes a little bit more problematic and you're increasing

25
00:04:39,151 --> 00:04:42,538
the risk of experiencing upper respiratory tract infection.

26
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:47,429
So this is a pretty good model, but.

27
00:04:47,429 --> 00:04:50,413
I wanna start us off today with thinking about

28
00:04:50,413 --> 00:04:54,557
some potential factors that may influence the J-curve model.

29
00:04:55,398 --> 00:04:58,362
And especially if we're looking at those elite endurance

30
00:04:58,362 --> 00:05:04,189
athletes or elite athletes who are maybe consistently on the further end of the J-curve.

31
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,513
So let's take a couple minutes, chat with your

32
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:10,416
classmates, and we'll come back together after that.

33
00:07:12,638 --> 00:07:14,620
Okay, what are we thinking here?

34
00:07:17,803 --> 00:07:21,207
Can I get some thoughts of what you kind of touched on?

35
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,030
So there's this idea, right?

36
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,393
As you increase in exercise intensity and duration, right,

37
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:32,799
the heavier you're exerting yourself to do exercise consistently

38
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:38,224
over time, you're increasing the risk for experiencing an upper respiratory tract infection.

39
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:43,499
But maybe there's something else going on that might influence the J curve.

40
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:48,866
What do we think might also be influencing this curve?

41
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:59,781
With elite athletes, especially, they're used to a higher

42
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:00,802
level of exercise or higher intensity of exercise.

43
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:01,343
So their bodies may be more

44
00:08:03,145 --> 00:08:07,131
Yeah, so that is true that as we continue to

45
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:11,358
exercise regularly, you do improve your immune system.

46
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,104
But I guess the other side to that is let's just

47
00:08:15,104 --> 00:08:18,910
assume that even though they have an improved immune system,

48
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,916
that as they continue to exert themselves a little bit

49
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:27,043
more than a recreationally active individual, they start to

50
00:08:27,043 --> 00:08:30,368
increase the number of upper respiratory tract infections.

51
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:36,303
And so the question maybe is, is it just intensity

52
00:08:36,303 --> 00:08:40,864
and duration, or is there something else maybe contributing to this?

53
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,346
Yeah, so there's a lot of different maybe psychological

54
00:08:48,346 --> 00:08:54,494
stresses associated with being an elite athlete, and that might contribute to a depressed immune system.

55
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:58,699
We will later talk about how cortisol release does

56
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:02,744
depress the immune system function a little bit, so that's a good one.

57
00:09:02,744 --> 00:09:03,325
What else?

58
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,222
Yeah, yeah.

59
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:17,647
So depending on when you're exercising or some of these

60
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:20,210
teams, they have to wake up really, really early.

61
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:26,118
And maybe they're not getting as much sleep as they should be getting in the first place.

62
00:09:26,118 --> 00:09:28,100
And then you wake them up really early, and then you

63
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,844
have them train one or two times throughout the day.

64
00:09:30,844 --> 00:09:33,287
And their sleep is being impacted.

65
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:35,410
In addition, if they're traveling a lot and they're

66
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,936
crossing all these time zones, maybe their sleep is becoming a little bit more disrupted.

67
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:40,737
That's a good one.

68
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:43,623
Anything else?

69
00:09:47,091 --> 00:09:47,993
Yeah, there are a few others.

70
00:09:50,098 --> 00:09:52,003
Same with the travel piece.

71
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:59,721
If I'm always traveling, maybe you're just exposing or I'm being exposed to more pathogens.

72
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:03,743
I'm going to, maybe I'm on a bus or I'm at the

73
00:10:03,743 --> 00:10:10,072
airport, and there are just more chances for me to get exposed to certain pathogens.

74
00:10:10,072 --> 00:10:12,296
Mental stress, like someone had mentioned earlier.

75
00:10:13,097 --> 00:10:17,304
Diet could be a little bit of an issue because they're always training.

76
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:20,849
There are some reported differences between sex.

77
00:10:20,849 --> 00:10:23,433
So they saw that elite females preparing or competing in

78
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:28,341
the Olympics had an increased risk for an upper respiratory tract infection.

79
00:10:29,722 --> 00:10:35,873
These are just all some other factors to think about when we're looking at that J-curve model.

80
00:10:35,873 --> 00:10:40,361
So yes, elite endurance athletes are typically towards that

81
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:45,470
end of high intensity exercise all the time, but some of these

82
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:52,202
other factors could also be in play, and we just need to kind of keep that in mind.

83
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,707
But regular exercise reduces the risk of an upper

84
00:10:56,707 --> 00:11:02,377
respiratory tract infection approximately 16 to 67% and less than

85
00:11:02,377 --> 00:11:08,568
60 minutes of exercise at around 50% VO2 max is all you

86
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:16,182
really need to help improve or reduce the risk of an upper respiratory tract infection.

87
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:23,076
Some of the mechanisms explaining that, we touched on a few of these on Thursday,

88
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:28,220
but if we're improving immunosurveillance or kind of hiding,

89
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:33,084
like our immune system is a little bit heightened, so we can better fight off some pathogens.

90
00:11:34,766 --> 00:11:38,969
If we have that regular kind of submaximal exercise,

91
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:44,714
sometimes we see some associations with less emotional stress.

92
00:11:45,695 --> 00:11:47,819
If I'm active,

93
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:51,264
Sometimes that makes individuals want to eat a little

94
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:54,869
bit better, so better nutrition has also been reported.

95
00:11:54,869 --> 00:11:57,933
And then adequate sleep, sort of the reverse side, right?

96
00:11:57,933 --> 00:12:00,136
If I'm not always doing two a days, early in the

97
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,761
morning, late at night, then the likelihood of you getting

98
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:10,030
maybe a little bit better sleep with some regular exercise is possible.

99
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:16,456
Okay, so this is a moderate exercise.

100
00:12:16,456 --> 00:12:18,259
and we're protecting against infection.

101
00:12:19,802 --> 00:12:23,148
If we go back to the high intensity, long duration

102
00:12:23,148 --> 00:12:30,040
aerobic exercise, this increases the risk for infection like we had mentioned or saw on the J-curve model.

103
00:12:31,022 --> 00:12:34,929
The reason for this is something called the open window.

104
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:41,080
This open window is an increased risk of infection.

105
00:12:43,456 --> 00:12:47,808
One of the mechanisms to potentially explain this would be

106
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:51,860
that we see some higher cortisol levels in these individuals

107
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,748
who are experiencing this type of exercise activity.

108
00:12:56,753 --> 00:12:59,760
Like we touched on, there are other factors that might be in play.

109
00:13:00,703 --> 00:13:04,412
But as far as cortisol and some of the other suppressive

110
00:13:04,412 --> 00:13:10,366
effects of the immune system, if we have time on the x-axis

111
00:13:10,366 --> 00:13:14,236
and then the baseline is kind of that dotted line,

112
00:13:14,236 --> 00:13:20,505
And then on the top of it, we have this kind of improved immune function or system.

113
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:28,616
And then below it is immunosuppression or you're decreasing the immunosurveillance.

114
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:35,605
As you're exercising over here, there happens to be a little bit of an improvement.

115
00:13:35,605 --> 00:13:42,555
But if we keep getting into this kind of increase in duration or after the exercise,

116
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:48,005
we see this acute depression in our immune function.

117
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:54,715
And so if you do an intense high intensity exercise

118
00:13:54,715 --> 00:14:02,245
here, as you are recovering, there's this window where you

119
00:14:02,245 --> 00:14:07,552
have potentially an increased risk for getting some type of infection.

120
00:14:09,655 --> 00:14:11,918
Again, this is with that high intensity exercise.

121
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:21,444
So there's a pretty good paper kind of supporting this model or this idea of the open window.

122
00:14:23,426 --> 00:14:30,072
So in 2019, a paper was published on the temporary immune dysfunction after heavy exercise.

123
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:33,054
So if we're looking in the dark blue lines here, these

124
00:14:33,054 --> 00:14:37,578
are a marathon race where the light blue are walking bouts.

125
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:44,925
So you don't need to know all of these over here, but essentially,

126
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:50,039
If we are on the left side of this line right here,

127
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:55,109
this is a negative change or a depression of the immune system.

128
00:14:57,473 --> 00:15:01,881
This over here for these ones are inflammatory markers.

129
00:15:03,023 --> 00:15:07,972
So they're getting a greater change in inflammation due to

130
00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:10,356
the marathon race compared to a walking bout.

131
00:15:14,588 --> 00:15:19,175
So definitely something's going on, especially after

132
00:15:19,175 --> 00:15:23,722
a high-intensity, long-duration kind of exercise event.

133
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:29,070
But luckily, it is an acute kind of depression.

134
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,987
So it will kind of come back up.

135
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:36,474
So then this idea of increasing the risk, if you have an intense exercise bout

136
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:41,322
and then right after that, maybe you're traveling or you're meeting with individuals

137
00:15:41,322 --> 00:15:45,028
or you're having some type of press conference and you're in a crowded room,

138
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:50,276
it's possible that now they are just in this kind

139
00:15:50,276 --> 00:15:55,665
of depressive state for their immune system and they're more likely to get an infection.

140
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,721
Say again?

141
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:03,743
Number of hours kind of like post-exercise.

142
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:12,272
Oh, well, yeah, so I guess it depends, because they always go hand in hand.

143
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:19,259
Like in this one, they're kind of saying, OK, we're exercising over here for one to two hours.

144
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:20,260
Is that kind of what you're asking?

145
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:22,963
Yeah, yeah.

146
00:16:22,963 --> 00:16:23,663
Well, every day.

147
00:16:25,665 --> 00:16:26,786
No, per day.

148
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:29,750
Yeah, so if I undergo one exercise bout,

149
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,793
After that, I'll see that open window.

150
00:16:31,793 --> 00:16:35,419
Then the next day, if I have another exercise bowel, I'll just have another open window.

151
00:16:36,301 --> 00:16:38,785
And so if I'm exercising every day at that type

152
00:16:38,785 --> 00:16:42,311
of intensity, I'm just having this window that's open for

153
00:16:42,311 --> 00:16:47,078
me to have an increased risk for upper respiratory tract infection or any type of infection.

154
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,993
Okay, with that being said though, overall,

155
00:16:57,104 --> 00:17:03,989
We have these temporary depressions of the immune system and temporary increases in inflammation.

156
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:10,437
But on a whole, if you look at a resting athlete versus a sedentary athlete,

157
00:17:10,437 --> 00:17:13,521
or not a sedentary athlete, but a sedentary individual

158
00:17:13,521 --> 00:17:18,688
or an obese individual, we actually see that the resting

159
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:27,499
levels of inflammatory markers are much higher in the sedentary group compared to the athletic group.

160
00:17:31,073 --> 00:17:36,039
So the idea here is that moderate exercise training

161
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:43,007
in general is unlikely to maybe eliminate inflammation.

162
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:51,237
But we can slowly try to change the body composition

163
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:59,997
and undergo some chronic exercise to help us decrease the risk of maybe having these

164
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:08,513
chronic inflammatory, I guess, states or areas or inflammatory markers in our blood.

165
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:22,238
Any questions on this one here?

166
00:18:22,238 --> 00:18:29,406
Again, these pieces right here are more for your information, like on these grayed out slides.

167
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:30,868
I mean, they do help you with some of the other

168
00:18:30,868 --> 00:18:33,490
pieces, but I never directly test you on these figures.

169
00:18:37,755 --> 00:18:42,400
Okay, so let's try a review question right here based on what we've talked about so far.

170
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:51,250
Which statement or statements below

171
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:53,698
is or are true.

172
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:04,564
Let's go 30 more seconds on this.

173
00:20:04,564 --> 00:20:05,806
Does anyone need a little more time?

174
00:20:09,893 --> 00:20:09,993
Okay.

175
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:26,560
Okay, 15 more seconds.

176
00:20:32,446 --> 00:20:37,713
All right, I'll close it down in three, two, one.

177
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,781
All right, how did we do?

178
00:20:43,781 --> 00:20:48,548
Oh, pretty close, almost, almost.

179
00:20:52,313 --> 00:20:54,896
That was close, that was close, it's okay.

180
00:20:54,896 --> 00:20:56,780
All right, so.

181
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,482
D is the correct answer.

182
00:20:58,482 --> 00:21:01,005
The J-curve model is the relationship that identifies

183
00:21:01,005 --> 00:21:05,290
potential benefits and drawbacks between different chronic exercise workloads.

184
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:10,496
We can go through a few of these, but sometimes when you

185
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:12,699
see a question, a lot of the times I like to

186
00:21:12,699 --> 00:21:16,303
just double check that everything's okay, but moderate exercise, less

187
00:21:16,303 --> 00:21:19,587
than 60 minutes will have a negative effect on the immune function.

188
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:22,450
What's wrong with this one?

189
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:32,311
Yeah, yeah, we see some benefits to moderate exercise less than 60 minutes.

190
00:21:32,311 --> 00:21:38,532
B, long duration intense exercise can temporarily boost the immune system.

191
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:42,157
Yeah, I see some people going down.

192
00:21:42,157 --> 00:21:44,800
No, it doesn't boost it, but it'll temporarily drop it

193
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,267
down, which is basically the open window here.

194
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:53,293
And so the open window increases the risk of

195
00:21:53,293 --> 00:21:58,861
infection due to the increased, well, decreased immunoseveral.

196
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,406
So we have these two words that kind of flipped here.

197
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:05,110
Any questions on this?

198
00:22:08,043 --> 00:22:14,230
Okay, I thought I was gonna have to add that one, but that's okay.

199
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,654
Okay, factors affecting susceptibility to infection in athletes.

200
00:22:19,597 --> 00:22:24,583
We talked about this, but increased exposure to pathogens, whether that's due to travel,

201
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:28,047
or maybe because I'm always, if I'm a team-based sport, I'm

202
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:31,891
always with my team, and so if one individual gets sick,

203
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:36,697
then it's more likely that everyone else may be exposed to that same pathogen.

204
00:22:36,697 --> 00:22:43,445
Inadequate diet, we'll get into this concept of reds or the athlete triad as well.

205
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:47,749
Mental stress, lack of sleep, and exercise-induced immune suppression.

206
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:50,693
So that open window as well as the J-curve concept here.

207
00:22:52,294 --> 00:22:55,598
All of these are gonna increase the risk for infection.

208
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:01,725
Okay, exercise in the aging immune system.

209
00:23:03,427 --> 00:23:06,431
Don't worry about memorizing anything on this figure.

210
00:23:06,431 --> 00:23:09,855
This is more for you just to kind of take a look at.

211
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,799
But the big kind of concept we're trying to take away

212
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:19,307
from this is aging is associated with the decline in the function of our immune system.

213
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:23,132
And we call it immunosenescence.

214
00:23:23,132 --> 00:23:26,516
And so again, aging is associated with a decline in

215
00:23:26,516 --> 00:23:29,400
the immune system or the function of the immune system.

216
00:23:32,182 --> 00:23:36,587
So regular moderate exercise, just like for individuals who

217
00:23:36,587 --> 00:23:41,753
are younger, will help individuals who are older.

218
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:47,359
So regular moderate exercise can improve the immune function via these pathways here.

219
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,143
So not a whole lot there.

220
00:23:51,143 --> 00:23:55,988
We just know that as we age, we have that decline in immune function.

221
00:23:55,988 --> 00:23:59,671
We can try to reduce the rate of decline

222
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:02,073
by keeping up with moderate exercise activity.

223
00:24:05,817 --> 00:24:07,619
Okay, what about different environments?

224
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:14,465
We'll start with the top one, exercise in the hot environment or in a hot environment.

225
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:20,050
We typically see elevated levels of cortisol compared to cool environments.

226
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:26,654
However, the difference or that delta in that cortisol level

227
00:24:26,654 --> 00:24:29,941
is not enough to impair the immune function.

228
00:24:32,788 --> 00:24:36,196
So if you exercise in a hot room compared to a

229
00:24:36,196 --> 00:24:43,532
cool room, you are not in a significantly greater risk of an upper respiratory tract infection.

230
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:50,549
Yeah, yeah, that definitely impacts performance, but as far

231
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:52,971
as immune function, you're not at more risk.

232
00:24:55,774 --> 00:25:01,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

233
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,002
The delta, it's just because, like, let's say your

234
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,226
increase in cortisol levels is here during normal exercise in

235
00:25:07,226 --> 00:25:09,248
a cool environment, and maybe it's like right here.

236
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:14,413
There is a significant difference, but it's just not enough to impact the immune system.

237
00:25:17,431 --> 00:25:20,321
from the literature that we have for right now.

238
00:25:20,321 --> 00:25:21,606
Okay, exercise in the cold.

239
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:26,273
Same deal, does not have negative effects on the immune system.

240
00:25:26,273 --> 00:25:30,581
So it appears that exercising purely in the cold is not

241
00:25:30,581 --> 00:25:34,329
gonna give you an increased risk for an infection.

242
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:38,557
It just so happens that we have a higher rate

243
00:25:38,557 --> 00:25:44,809
of individuals who are experiencing some type of infection, like a cold, in the winter months.

244
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:48,957
And then if you're exercising in the winter and you have that kind of open window,

245
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:56,354
Well, then you're increasing the risk of infection, but it's not due to the cold itself.

246
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:59,960
It just so happens to be you're potentially having an

247
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,909
open window around a lot of other individuals who may or may not have an infection.

248
00:26:07,975 --> 00:26:10,219
Okay, exercise at high altitude.

249
00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:15,125
This one we do see a significant increase in the cortisol levels.

250
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:21,295
And that increase in those cortisol levels are enough at

251
00:26:21,295 --> 00:26:27,786
higher altitudes to increase the risk of an upper respiratory tract infection or an infection in general.

252
00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:32,153
This one's a little interesting.

253
00:26:32,153 --> 00:26:37,419
I would, if you want to like ignore one of these points on the slide, this one would be it here.

254
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,183
So it is interesting because there were some, I

255
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:46,088
guess, inflicting results in a paper published after they looked

256
00:26:46,088 --> 00:26:50,513
at individuals who were living or I guess acutely went to a high altitude.

257
00:26:51,714 --> 00:26:55,863
They then did a similar study with individuals in a lab.

258
00:26:55,863 --> 00:27:00,288
and they put them on hypoxic gas, and they didn't see

259
00:27:00,288 --> 00:27:04,913
the same depression in the immune system as this up here.

260
00:27:06,274 --> 00:27:08,797
But there was a little bit of a disagreement that

261
00:27:08,797 --> 00:27:13,602
maybe the investigators in this study didn't replicate the

262
00:27:13,602 --> 00:27:19,948
same, I guess, stress, altitude exposure stress as going to,

263
00:27:19,948 --> 00:27:24,820
say, Pike's Peak, for example, or maybe a little bit higher than that.

264
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,747
So that's why there's a little bit of a conflicting result there.

265
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:32,254
But at least for this course and in general, if you

266
00:27:32,254 --> 00:27:44,778
go to high altitude, we do see an increased risk for an upper respiratory tract infection.

267
00:27:44,778 --> 00:27:45,980
So is this with people who just like me frequently go

268
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,082
up to high altitude or like if somebody was like born

269
00:27:48,682 --> 00:27:53,508
Yeah, even people who live at higher altitudes in general are

270
00:27:53,508 --> 00:27:57,794
at a little bit of a higher risk compared to individuals who are not at that high altitude.

271
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:02,280
Over time, it does get better, but they are at a higher risk.

272
00:28:04,443 --> 00:28:04,563
Yeah.

273
00:28:04,563 --> 00:28:07,467
And so that does remind me on another piece here.

274
00:28:08,881 --> 00:28:12,826
Some people, actually the majority of the exercise

275
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:19,054
physiology community, considers Denver or Boulder area as not even moderate altitude.

276
00:28:19,054 --> 00:28:20,736
They would consider it low altitude.

277
00:28:21,597 --> 00:28:24,641
So sometimes when they're doing lab studies, they don't

278
00:28:24,641 --> 00:28:27,725
actually simulate a high enough altitude to maybe get the

279
00:28:27,725 --> 00:28:33,472
same exposure that people are getting at these actual places they're living in.

280
00:28:33,472 --> 00:28:36,202
So for example, if you went up to Pike's Peak,

281
00:28:36,202 --> 00:28:40,207
Well, that decrease in partial pressure needs to be matched in

282
00:28:40,207 --> 00:28:43,692
the lab in that we just need some follow-up studies to confirm that.

283
00:28:47,877 --> 00:28:50,721
Okay, any questions on this one here?

284
00:28:54,426 --> 00:28:56,608
Yeah, so for this one they were at 14, 10 and

285
00:28:56,608 --> 00:29:03,037
14,000 feet and they found depression in the immune system.

286
00:29:03,037 --> 00:29:03,998
So basically like,

287
00:29:05,007 --> 00:29:10,334
I think maybe Dillon area, like Keystone, that's like really

288
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:26,717
close to that, and then Pike's Peak, anything above that starts to become problematic.

289
00:29:26,717 --> 00:29:27,498
Okay.

290
00:29:27,498 --> 00:29:28,784
Okay, so then,

291
00:29:28,784 --> 00:29:32,167
that question we started off this kind of slide deck with.

292
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:33,709
Should you exercise when you have a cold?

293
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,593
I think most of us kind of said, well, it depends.

294
00:29:37,593 --> 00:29:39,595
I know we were on yes or no, but it does depend.

295
00:29:40,776 --> 00:29:45,220
In general, it is okay to exercise if you have symptoms above the neck.

296
00:29:46,462 --> 00:29:48,163
And what we're talking about above the neck, we're

297
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:53,729
talking about runny nose, maybe some congestion or a mild sore throat.

298
00:29:53,729 --> 00:29:58,838
But no matter what, the intensity and duration should be reduced.

299
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,780
if that individual starts the exercise.

300
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:05,385
We should not exercise if the symptoms are below

301
00:30:05,385 --> 00:30:08,769
the neck, meaning something's inside of the lungs.

302
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:12,152
You have some chest congestion, or you have some type

303
00:30:12,152 --> 00:30:17,979
of cough inside the lungs, or you have muscle aches, or fevers, or stomach pain, right?

304
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,043
So that's kind of what we're looking at here.

305
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:28,390
I think one of the biggest problems, not problems, but I guess negative

306
00:30:29,534 --> 00:30:36,002
with elite athletes who are trying to train is if you are taking them away from training.

307
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:40,948
In general, if someone gets sick, you usually recover a lot

308
00:30:40,948 --> 00:30:44,914
faster if you take it really easy in the subsequent day or

309
00:30:44,914 --> 00:30:48,538
two, as opposed to just trying to hammer it every single

310
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:52,703
time, and then you're just gonna prolong the recovery.

311
00:30:52,703 --> 00:30:55,667
And it's those multiple days without training that

312
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:58,711
become problematic for these elite endurance athletes.

313
00:30:58,711 --> 00:31:01,996
For recreationally active individuals, it's not that big of a

314
00:31:01,996 --> 00:31:06,603
deal because a lot of times we're only exercising three, four times a week, maybe five times.

315
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:10,369
But in general, it's okay if it's above the neck.

316
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,495
Should be really kind of cautious if it's below the neck.

317
00:31:14,495 --> 00:31:16,518
And then if we're having fever, muscle aches, or

318
00:31:16,518 --> 00:31:21,185
any type of fatigue like that, definitely probably should stay away from exercise.

319
00:31:25,813 --> 00:31:26,494
Any questions?

320
00:31:26,494 --> 00:31:27,435
Oh yeah.

321
00:31:29,795 --> 00:31:32,380
It's okay.

322
00:31:36,376 --> 00:31:38,439
Yeah, are you saying up here?

323
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:40,581
Yeah, so it's fine to do it.

324
00:31:40,581 --> 00:31:43,165
I think there's two areas of thought.

325
00:31:44,066 --> 00:31:48,892
One, you do temporarily improve the immune system with that moderate exercise.

326
00:31:48,892 --> 00:31:51,395
But if you're adding extra stress on the body to

327
00:31:51,395 --> 00:31:57,263
recover from that exercise, that's less energy you're able to fight off the pathogens.

328
00:31:57,263 --> 00:32:01,452
So maybe it's a wash, and that's why it's OK.

329
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:05,319
But we definitely should not be doing it if we're dealing with something else.

330
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:10,388
One, if it's in the lungs, because then you could potentially cause it to become more problematic.

331
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,331
Yeah, that's a good question.

332
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,141
Any other questions?

333
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:22,664
OK.

334
00:32:22,664 --> 00:32:24,607
I mean, that's pretty straightforward, right?

335
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:29,195
Not too bad for the immune and endocrine, I guess, slides.

336
00:32:29,195 --> 00:32:35,105
The bulk of the material is coming from slides or chapters three and four as well as chapters one.

337
00:32:36,348 --> 00:32:42,017
But that doesn't necessarily mean all of the questions are gonna be coming from those chapters.

338
00:32:42,017 --> 00:32:48,128
So I would spend your time appropriately throughout all of the slides.

339
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,591
There's going to be 32.

340
00:32:49,591 --> 00:32:53,438
I thought it was going to be 33 with the added question.

341
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:57,506
But you'll have maybe some other opportunities in a little bit here.

342
00:32:57,506 --> 00:32:59,209
But 32 multiple choice questions.

343
00:33:00,552 --> 00:33:03,077
I would use the lecture notes and the learning goals to study.

344
00:33:03,077 --> 00:33:06,143
The learning goals are a great place to start.

345
00:33:06,143 --> 00:33:09,850
I wouldn't say that's the only thing you need to learn or know.

346
00:33:10,893 --> 00:33:14,398
Calculator, number two pencil, highlighter can be really helpful

347
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:19,605
because half the battle is just making sure you understand what the question is asking.

348
00:33:19,605 --> 00:33:24,132
Sometimes students will answer a question but it's actually,

349
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:29,199
it's not wrong what they're trying to say but it's not really answering the question at hand.

350
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,505
You can't use your phone as a calculator and I'll

351
00:33:33,505 --> 00:33:38,129
give you formulas and conversion factors and you can write on the exam.

352
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:39,111
Any general question?

353
00:33:39,111 --> 00:33:43,478
Oh, if you have accommodations, you should have emails.

354
00:33:43,478 --> 00:33:47,304
I sent a reminder email to everybody today, I believe.

355
00:33:47,304 --> 00:33:50,168
But if you have not got an email and you have

356
00:33:50,168 --> 00:33:54,275
accommodations, you need to see me today, like after lecture.

357
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,281
For the formulas, are you able to place that

358
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:04,605
No, only because only the formulas that are posted

359
00:34:04,605 --> 00:34:08,190
on there are applicable to the questions themselves.

360
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,693
So that kind of gives away maybe what you would need

361
00:34:10,693 --> 00:34:13,317
to know and what you wouldn't need to know sometimes.

362
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:18,964
So I don't want to push you in one direction or

363
00:34:18,964 --> 00:34:21,788
the other just because only a certain number of formulas are listed.

364
00:34:22,797 --> 00:34:26,664
And I don't wanna post like three pages of formulas to have everything.

365
00:34:27,506 --> 00:34:29,129
Yeah, good question.

366
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:30,832
Anything else on the exam?

367
00:34:32,395 --> 00:34:32,976
Format.

368
00:34:35,981 --> 00:34:38,325
Okay, cool.

369
00:34:38,325 --> 00:34:40,730
So let's do a few review questions.

370
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,074
Again, you're more than welcome to chat with your neighbors,

371
00:34:43,074 --> 00:34:47,418
but in my opinion, when I show some of these clicker questions,

372
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:52,827
I would take some time, read it on your own, try to answer it on your own,

373
00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:56,894
and then after you're kind of done with that, maybe then chat with your neighbor,

374
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:59,939
because you've got to really challenge yourself to see

375
00:34:59,939 --> 00:35:02,904
whether you actually understand what the question is asking, one,

376
00:35:02,904 --> 00:35:06,169
and number two, maybe why it's wrong and why it's correct.

377
00:35:06,976 --> 00:35:09,379
Okay, so these are clicker questions.

378
00:35:09,379 --> 00:35:13,103
I'll open them up just because then you'll have access to them later.

379
00:35:13,103 --> 00:35:14,966
So I would like you to click in on these.

380
00:35:14,966 --> 00:35:16,968
Plus, I'll still do it.

381
00:35:16,968 --> 00:35:18,510
If we get 100, we're in good shape.

382
00:35:24,878 --> 00:35:29,223
Okay, two athletes of the same size and same VO2 max are cycling at 100 watts.

383
00:35:29,223 --> 00:35:35,050
One individual is expending 5.2 kcal per minute and the other is expending 4.7 kcal per minute.

384
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,932
Which statement below is true?

385
00:37:23,933 --> 00:37:27,859
Okay, let's go maybe 30 more seconds.

386
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:29,622
Do you feel like you need a little bit more time than that?

387
00:37:32,306 --> 00:37:35,031
And we'll go through this one as well.

388
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,444
So double check you have something clicked in.

389
00:37:52,942 --> 00:37:53,943
Okay, 10 seconds.

390
00:37:57,987 --> 00:38:02,131
I think we're missing one clicker, so double check you have something in.

391
00:38:02,131 --> 00:38:03,252
Close it down in five.

392
00:38:05,414 --> 00:38:08,357
Three, two, one, nice.

393
00:38:08,357 --> 00:38:09,559
Okay, that last person is in.

394
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:13,863
Okay.

395
00:38:13,863 --> 00:38:14,423
How did we do?

396
00:38:14,423 --> 00:38:17,987
We did great here.

397
00:38:22,186 --> 00:38:28,634
There was a point in time though, where I think we were almost 50-50 on these ones here.

398
00:38:31,337 --> 00:38:36,743
So let me ask the group here, why can you not say,

399
00:38:36,743 --> 00:38:39,486
so that's correct that D is right and C is wrong, but why

400
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:42,129
can you say, why can you not say the economies are different?

401
00:38:42,129 --> 00:38:48,717
Because the exercise economy is about oxygen consumption,

402
00:38:50,654 --> 00:38:51,916
Yeah, yeah.

403
00:38:51,916 --> 00:38:52,738
So that is true.

404
00:38:52,738 --> 00:38:55,543
So we need VO2, we need oxygen consumption.

405
00:38:56,505 --> 00:39:00,712
But would you agree we need oxygen consumption to get to Kcals?

406
00:39:00,712 --> 00:39:03,798
So what else would we need in order to solve this problem?

407
00:39:05,541 --> 00:39:06,823
Or to determine economy?

408
00:39:08,677 --> 00:39:10,782
Yeah, so you would need substrate utilization.

409
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:12,906
So you would need the RER chart.

410
00:39:12,906 --> 00:39:16,895
And on the RER chart, you'd have to go to the caloric equivalent.

411
00:39:16,895 --> 00:39:20,183
And then after that, you can multiply the oxygen consumption.

412
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:22,448
But depending on whether it's given to you in

413
00:39:22,448 --> 00:39:27,391
normalized, milliliters per kilogram per minute or liters per minute, then you would need body mass.

414
00:39:27,391 --> 00:39:29,856
So there's a lot missing here that we can't back

415
00:39:29,856 --> 00:39:34,805
calculate and determine whether someone is more economical or

416
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:38,452
not based on these two energy expenditures here.

417
00:39:39,854 --> 00:39:43,241
Because it's possible someone could be on the low end

418
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:48,150
burning more fats than carbs and that does change energy expenditure.

419
00:39:49,075 --> 00:39:49,836
Good.

420
00:39:49,836 --> 00:39:53,341
The other piece, you would have to kind of understand what efficiency is.

421
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:56,807
Who wants to help me out with what efficiency is in

422
00:39:56,807 --> 00:40:00,412
the context of this problem or what we've talked about in exercise physiology?

423
00:40:01,854 --> 00:40:03,377
You can even list the formula.

424
00:40:08,544 --> 00:40:09,426
Achieving maximum productivity.

425
00:40:09,426 --> 00:40:11,609
Good, yeah, so that's a great definition.

426
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:14,914
Can someone else help me out with the formula?

427
00:40:19,096 --> 00:40:25,567
Yeah, yeah, so mechanical work over kind of metabolic work or mechanical power or metabolic power.

428
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:28,673
And you are trying to achieve kind of the maximum amount

429
00:40:28,673 --> 00:40:31,879
of work done with the least amount of energy used.

430
00:40:31,879 --> 00:40:34,704
We have energy here in kcals per minute, so we're in good shape.

431
00:40:35,785 --> 00:40:38,090
So the reason the economy, just to recap real quick,

432
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:41,195
the reason the economies are the same is because they both have the same VO2.

433
00:40:41,195 --> 00:40:44,780
So we don't know whether the economies are the same or different.

434
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,884
Yeah, so I cannot determine that information.

435
00:40:47,884 --> 00:40:51,388
So I don't know if economies are the same or if economies are different.

436
00:40:51,388 --> 00:40:54,852
So BNC, I don't really know.

437
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,534
What would we need in this case?

438
00:40:56,534 --> 00:40:59,658
Yeah, so we would need oxygen consumption.

439
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:02,922
And then we would also need RER, or the caloric equivalent,

440
00:41:02,922 --> 00:41:05,665
and then body mass if it was given to you in a relative.

441
00:41:05,665 --> 00:41:08,128
Then you could back calculate to oxygen consumption.

442
00:41:08,128 --> 00:41:11,290
So VO2 max is not a reasonable, like,

443
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:14,654
Knowing that someone is at VO2 max or some percentage of

444
00:41:14,654 --> 00:41:19,500
VO2 max or that an individual has the same VO2 max is not a good indication of this.

445
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:21,663
Yeah.

446
00:41:21,663 --> 00:41:23,985
I was going to put it here, but I could have

447
00:41:23,985 --> 00:41:30,253
easily on E put both exercise economy and efficiency are the same.

448
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:33,377
And I have a feeling a lot of you would have selected E,

449
00:41:33,377 --> 00:41:36,100
but I was trying to make it a little more straightforward than that.

450
00:41:38,645 --> 00:41:43,101
Any other questions on why we got to where the correct answer is here?

451
00:41:46,412 --> 00:41:47,777
Okay, let's try another one.

452
00:41:56,279 --> 00:41:59,107
Joanne is running on a treadmill starting at miles per hour.

453
00:41:59,107 --> 00:42:02,456
She then increases the treadmill speed.

454
00:42:02,456 --> 00:42:03,278
Shouldn't be an S there.

455
00:42:03,278 --> 00:42:04,882
Speed to seven miles per hour.

456
00:42:04,882 --> 00:42:11,841
When comparing the increase in speed, which of the following would we not expect to occur?

457
00:43:44,347 --> 00:43:50,273
Let's try another minute or so, 45 seconds.

458
00:44:50,075 --> 00:44:52,178
Okay, let's make sure we got something in.

459
00:44:52,178 --> 00:44:56,845
How are we doing?

460
00:45:00,471 --> 00:45:01,172
We're doing great.

461
00:45:02,774 --> 00:45:03,836
Missing that one clicker.

462
00:45:04,657 --> 00:45:06,860
I'll close it down in 10 seconds.

463
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,062
Oh, perfect.

464
00:45:08,062 --> 00:45:08,783
Anyone need more time?

465
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:14,091
Okay, three, two, one.

466
00:45:20,568 --> 00:45:22,231
Nice, this is great.

467
00:45:27,401 --> 00:45:29,665
I know it's not fun that we didn't get the hundred,

468
00:45:29,665 --> 00:45:35,772
but if you truly read this question and answered it and got the correct answer,

469
00:45:35,772 --> 00:45:38,076
I mean, you don't need that free question.

470
00:45:38,076 --> 00:45:40,862
96% average on the exam.

471
00:45:40,862 --> 00:45:41,763
It's going to be great.

472
00:45:41,763 --> 00:45:44,068
It's going to be great.

473
00:45:44,068 --> 00:45:45,931
You can't chat with each other.

474
00:45:45,931 --> 00:45:49,518
It is kind of funny watching the trend where it's like spread out amongst A

475
00:45:49,518 --> 00:45:52,924
through E, and then they all slowly kind of go

476
00:45:52,924 --> 00:45:57,473
towards the correct answer, which means you're probably chatting with your neighbors, which is great.

477
00:45:57,473 --> 00:46:00,056
Don't get that false sense of security because you can't ask,

478
00:46:00,056 --> 00:46:03,979
you can't phone a friend or ask your neighbor on the exam.

479
00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:07,223
Okay, so if we're going from five miles per hour to

480
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:10,986
seven miles per hour, that is an increase in exercise intensity.

481
00:46:12,047 --> 00:46:15,371
If we are looking at the increase in intensity and

482
00:46:15,371 --> 00:46:21,657
we see a decrease in the relative fat utilization, would we say that's true?

483
00:46:21,657 --> 00:46:22,838
Yeah, I would agree.

484
00:46:22,838 --> 00:46:27,562
So as intensity increases, carbohydrates go up, fats go down.

485
00:46:27,562 --> 00:46:30,745
B, an increase in the relative carbohydrate utilization.

486
00:46:30,745 --> 00:46:32,227
Well, that's just the opposite of that.

487
00:46:32,227 --> 00:46:33,809
So OK, we're in good shape here.

488
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:38,153
C, increase in glucagon and insulin concentration.

489
00:46:38,153 --> 00:46:39,635
This is the one everyone selected.

490
00:46:41,217 --> 00:46:42,638
Which one is the issue here?

491
00:46:42,638 --> 00:46:43,799
Or is there an issue with both of them?

492
00:46:43,799 --> 00:46:56,573
So as you can see, it's probably the correct, because yes, you can have all of these.

493
00:46:58,763 --> 00:47:01,386
Right, right, so there is an increase in glucagon,

494
00:47:02,907 --> 00:47:09,194
but insulin concentration decreases as we increase with exercise intensity.

495
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:11,857
So we should not see insulin on there.

496
00:47:11,857 --> 00:47:15,100
Increase in aldosterone and ADH concentration.

497
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,384
What's aldosterone and ADH?

498
00:47:18,384 --> 00:47:19,165
What are their goals?

499
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:27,133
What's aldosterone and ADH?

500
00:47:28,582 --> 00:47:31,968
So that's true, they do go up, but why?

501
00:47:31,968 --> 00:47:43,046
Yeah, yeah, so they both stimulate water reabsorption in the

502
00:47:43,046 --> 00:47:45,730
kidneys in response to a drop in plasma volume.

503
00:47:47,161 --> 00:47:51,428
So we would expect that to go up as exercise intensity increases.

504
00:47:52,709 --> 00:47:55,153
But you can also ask yourself a few other pieces as

505
00:47:55,153 --> 00:48:00,101
far as what implications does that have for plasma volume.

506
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:02,324
And then a decrease in exercise efficiency.

507
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:06,491
So we're thinking yes here.

508
00:48:08,313 --> 00:48:08,614
Why?

509
00:48:08,614 --> 00:48:13,181
I'll come back to you in a second.

510
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:13,962
Anyone else?

511
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:25,913
So why is that one okay?

512
00:48:25,913 --> 00:48:29,416
Yeah, so that's one of the three factors.

513
00:48:29,416 --> 00:48:32,241
that can influence exercise efficiency.

514
00:48:32,241 --> 00:48:35,687
So if you go back to those slides, which you were kind of around there

515
00:48:35,687 --> 00:48:42,197
since we were doing efficiency, but like workload, cadence,

516
00:48:42,197 --> 00:48:46,104
or step count, and then recruitment of type two fibers,

517
00:48:46,104 --> 00:48:52,535
so increasing that intensity, does impact or decrease efficiency.

518
00:48:54,378 --> 00:48:54,478
Yeah.

519
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,847
Oh, that's a good one.

520
00:49:01,847 --> 00:49:05,050
Yeah, so even if I put a decrease in absolute

521
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:08,353
fat utilization, could we say for sure that's happening?

522
00:49:10,355 --> 00:49:10,995
No, we can't.

523
00:49:10,995 --> 00:49:12,056
Yeah, that's a good response.

524
00:49:12,056 --> 00:49:15,639
So like that was on your lab question too.

525
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:19,483
In some situations, your absolute fat oxidation would be

526
00:49:19,483 --> 00:49:22,106
higher, and in some situations, it would be lower.

527
00:49:23,247 --> 00:49:25,489
So we couldn't even answer that question.

528
00:49:28,111 --> 00:49:29,072
What if I put,

529
00:49:32,478 --> 00:49:43,109
Oh, I guess we couldn't do that, but when does relative fat utilization not decrease?

530
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:45,392
Not necessarily with intensity, but when does it increase?

531
00:49:47,534 --> 00:49:49,096
When we're looking at substrate utilization.

532
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:52,580
With duration.

533
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:52,880
With duration.

534
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,584
So if it was flipped and we said this individual is

535
00:49:56,584 --> 00:50:00,980
running for four hours, well then that could probably be

536
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:02,567
both A and B would be incorrect.

537
00:50:05,117 --> 00:50:05,519
Okay, good.

538
00:50:08,451 --> 00:50:09,977
Let's try one more here.

539
00:50:18,277 --> 00:50:22,102
Two individuals exercise at a submaximal intensity for

540
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:26,368
10 minutes, reaching an oxygen consumption of two liters per minute.

541
00:50:26,368 --> 00:50:28,832
You look back at the first minute of data collection and

542
00:50:28,832 --> 00:50:36,823
notice individual A had a VO2 of 0.75 liters per minute and individual B was at 1.15 liters per minute.

543
00:50:37,925 --> 00:50:43,052
At minute one, both individuals are at or in what?

544
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,768
OK, how are we doing here?

545
00:53:35,729 --> 00:53:35,969
We good?

546
00:53:37,971 --> 00:53:39,172
Let's close this down.

547
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:41,814
Missing two clickers.

548
00:53:42,795 --> 00:53:44,417
We'll wait 10 seconds here, one clicker.

549
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:54,105
OK, closing it down in three, two, one.

550
00:53:55,947 --> 00:53:59,170
So I haven't even seen this, so I don't even know.

551
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:01,452
Oh, but I think you know before me.

552
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:07,052
Ooh, nice, nice.

553
00:54:07,052 --> 00:54:08,154
I'll take it, I'll take it.

554
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:11,299
So yes, B is the correct answer here.

555
00:54:14,463 --> 00:54:16,847
Can we tell whether they're at lactate threshold?

556
00:54:18,449 --> 00:54:18,610
No.

557
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:23,457
What would you need to determine whether someone is even

558
00:54:23,457 --> 00:54:26,882
at lactate threshold based off the tools that we've learned in class?

559
00:54:27,942 --> 00:54:29,906
Yeah, we'd have to graph it out, right?

560
00:54:29,906 --> 00:54:33,634
And then we'd have to see where it starts to exponentially increase.

561
00:54:33,634 --> 00:54:35,719
Okay, so we don't have that information.

562
00:54:35,719 --> 00:54:38,064
We can't tell whether they're at lactate threshold.

563
00:54:39,106 --> 00:54:40,048
Oxygen deficit.

564
00:54:41,731 --> 00:54:43,114
We're thinking yes, but why?

565
00:54:45,399 --> 00:54:46,221
I agree with you.

566
00:54:48,867 --> 00:54:57,898
Yeah, but you are correct in that, but what in

567
00:54:57,898 --> 00:55:00,868
the problem is telling you, confirming what you just said?

568
00:55:07,328 --> 00:55:11,902
Yeah.

569
00:55:11,902 --> 00:55:12,885
Yeah.

570
00:55:12,885 --> 00:55:13,527
Good.

571
00:55:13,527 --> 00:55:15,132
So they're exercising for 10 minutes.

572
00:55:15,132 --> 00:55:17,960
They reach two liters per minute of oxygen consumption.

573
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,643
We would consider that potentially steady state.

574
00:55:20,643 --> 00:55:22,706
So they're kind of hanging out there.

575
00:55:22,706 --> 00:55:28,633
But at the start of exercise, they're at a much lower oxygen consumption, .75 and 1.15.

576
00:55:29,614 --> 00:55:35,162
And so that gives us an indication that they are kind of in that rest to exercise transition.

577
00:55:36,223 --> 00:55:39,567
And because they are still exercising, they're not like

578
00:55:39,567 --> 00:55:47,517
falling off the treadmill, some other pathway is creating or generating ATP.

579
00:55:47,517 --> 00:55:50,481
What other pathway would that be, or pathways?

580
00:55:56,418 --> 00:55:59,582
Yeah, yeah, those immediate energy stores or non-oxidative

581
00:55:59,582 --> 00:56:07,613
glycolysis or the phosphocreatine kind of pathway, so the ATP-PCR pathway.

582
00:56:07,613 --> 00:56:09,256
All right, ketosis.

583
00:56:09,256 --> 00:56:14,783
Technically, we didn't even talk about this term, so that was kind of just the filler answer.

584
00:56:14,783 --> 00:56:16,005
EPOC, what's EPOC?

585
00:56:20,892 --> 00:56:25,378
Yeah, yeah, so if I saw these values at minute 11,

586
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:32,234
So if I just added one extra one here, then we

587
00:56:32,234 --> 00:56:36,599
could potentially think this is the best option here for epoch.

588
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:38,621
And then what would make E correct?

589
00:56:46,971 --> 00:56:57,103
What would I have to change in the problem to maybe make E correct?

590
00:56:59,598 --> 00:57:00,479
Good, good.

591
00:57:00,479 --> 00:57:05,246
So the biggest thing that he mentioned was not just at minute 10, but

592
00:57:05,246 --> 00:57:07,971
if in the problem it said from minutes five to 10,

593
00:57:09,012 --> 00:57:13,078
the VO2 or the oxygen consumption was at two liters per minute,

594
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:19,628
what state are they in at minute nine or something like that?

595
00:57:19,628 --> 00:57:24,816
Any minute in between there, and it would be a steady state.

596
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,098
Any other questions on this one?

597
00:57:29,022 --> 00:57:29,082
OK.

598
00:57:30,175 --> 00:57:32,998
So we definitely have a little bit more time, but I'm

599
00:57:32,998 --> 00:57:36,062
gonna open it up to the class for any questions that you have.

600
00:57:36,062 --> 00:57:39,726
So if you have any questions on the learning goals or

601
00:57:39,726 --> 00:57:43,410
slides, I'm more than happy to help you out with them.

602
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:50,297
If you're just like, too easy, I'm good, I would take no offense if you took off.

603
00:57:50,297 --> 00:57:53,721
But sometimes it's nice hearing other people's questions if they have any.

604
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:57,145
But again, I would not be offended if you took off, yeah.

605
00:58:01,529 --> 00:58:02,377
Say that one more time.
