1
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:48,035
All right.

2
00:03:50,477 --> 00:03:51,277
Let's get started.

3
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,379
Good to see you all.

4
00:03:54,961 --> 00:04:00,766
Not sure if we are gonna get a big snowstorm today, but we'll see how that weather goes.

5
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:06,831
Hopefully you're doing okay and that the second week of labs was good.

6
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:10,695
It was a little bit of probably

7
00:04:12,592 --> 00:04:15,054
not a wake-up or anything like that, but it was a lot of calculations.

8
00:04:15,635 --> 00:04:18,997
You're gonna have a very similar calculation-based lab next week.

9
00:04:19,378 --> 00:04:25,182
And then after that, the amount of calculations, especially like the Haldane equation, goes way down.

10
00:04:25,302 --> 00:04:27,904
So don't worry, not every lab is gonna be like that.

11
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:35,871
You should have plenty of time in the future labs to complete the majority, if not all, of the lab and turn it in during that time.

12
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:37,652
So just hang tight.

13
00:04:37,672 --> 00:04:41,175
We gotta get through these calculations before we move on to the fun stuff.

14
00:04:42,477 --> 00:04:46,001
Second piece, what's in two weeks, two Thursdays from now?

15
00:04:47,263 --> 00:04:48,524
Yeah, your first exam.

16
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:54,752
So your first lecture exam is in two Thursdays from today, so February 13th.

17
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:56,914
So please try to keep that in mind.

18
00:04:57,615 --> 00:05:02,100
One of the big things that I like to say right off the bat would be,

19
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:06,970
I don't know if you're struggling unless you tell me.

20
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:15,017
And so you want to get some things cleared up now before you find out on the exam if you struggle on the exam.

21
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:29,229
So I highly recommend if there are any slides or concepts or thought questions or study guide questions that are not making sense that we need to talk about it so we can clear that up.

22
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:31,711
Are we okay with that?

23
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:45,599
All right, and that does remind me since we are getting closer to the exams, this is spring semester, I know many of you are trying to graduate, and I know all of you care about your grade, but one thing I like to say is,

24
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,985
So I don't curve the class, because typically, like if it was below a certain amount, like the syllabus says, yeah, we will curve it.

25
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:55,806
But we don't round grades up.

26
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:57,067
We don't do anything like that.

27
00:05:57,907 --> 00:06:09,395
But if people are on the edge, some of the things that I do look for are like participation or at least attendance in lecture, as well as participation or attendance in lab.

28
00:06:10,095 --> 00:06:11,336
So I do check those.

29
00:06:11,897 --> 00:06:13,258
And so it's really good.

30
00:06:13,318 --> 00:06:20,304
And I know sometimes it's hard because there are bigger groups this semester, but it's very easy to kind of tuck away and kind of hide in the background.

31
00:06:21,245 --> 00:06:23,627
But I'm going to tell you right now, all your TAs can see that.

32
00:06:23,907 --> 00:06:27,250
So all these small little things do add up.

33
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,171
And if you are on the edge,

34
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:37,716
Right, we typically don't round, but those do make a big factor in some of those decisions.

35
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:39,378
So try to keep that in mind.

36
00:06:39,778 --> 00:06:44,023
You're already in lab, you might as well try to learn something and try to enjoy the lab.

37
00:06:44,463 --> 00:06:45,144
Same with lecture.

38
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:46,766
Are we okay there?

39
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:48,368
Okay, nice.

40
00:06:49,236 --> 00:06:53,699
All right, so we're gonna try to finish off bioenergetics and exercise metabolism.

41
00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:15,416
Quick review, we learned on Tuesday that exercise duration and fuel selection, if we're just looking at expanding the duration, so the duration of the exercise itself, as the duration increases, we shift from carbohydrate utilization towards fat utilization.

42
00:07:17,485 --> 00:07:19,166
So we ran through some clicker questions.

43
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:19,947
We looked at that.

44
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,208
Now we want to know why.

45
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:27,253
So most of this is due to an increased rate of lipolysis.

46
00:07:28,013 --> 00:07:30,676
And lipolysis, again, is the breakdown of triglycerides.

47
00:07:31,296 --> 00:07:42,025
We are mainly not really worried too much about this glycerol, but the pre-fatty acids.

48
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:57,861
These different lipases are freeing up these free fatty acids from the triglycerides so then we can undergo beta oxidation, get them into acetyl-CoA and then run them through the Krebs cycle and then eventually to the ETC.

49
00:07:59,722 --> 00:08:10,110
The rate of lipolysis increases as we increase the concentration of hormones like epinephrine and norepinephrine.

50
00:08:11,626 --> 00:08:27,736
Here, if we have duration and percent change of the hormone of interest, which is epinephrine or epinephrine, we could see that they substantially increase over time at the same exercise intensity.

51
00:08:28,557 --> 00:08:33,400
So we're not changing the exercise intensity here, just increasing the duration.

52
00:08:41,205 --> 00:08:42,526
So then what does this look like?

53
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:44,268
Well, it looks something like this.

54
00:08:45,249 --> 00:08:47,451
This is a nice little piece here to add in.

55
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:51,174
We are looking at submaximal exercise, not maximal exercise.

56
00:08:52,395 --> 00:09:03,225
Anytime we are doing any kind of substrate utilization, it needs to be primarily oxidative phosphorylation, submaximal, constant work rate.

57
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:04,927
Okay.

58
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:11,948
This is your substrate utilization in percent, exercise duration over here.

59
00:09:12,908 --> 00:09:20,049
As exercise duration increases, we see a decrease in carbohydrate utilization and an increase in fat utilization.

60
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:27,431
One of those mechanisms is because we're increasing lipolysis due to the increased secretion of epinephrine.

61
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:34,992
From a storage standpoint, so number two, second reason, from a storage standpoint,

62
00:09:36,862 --> 00:09:41,303
Which one of these do we have more or less an unlimited source?

63
00:09:44,924 --> 00:09:45,224
Fats.

64
00:09:45,604 --> 00:09:47,024
Yeah, so what about carbohydrates?

65
00:09:48,484 --> 00:09:48,684
No.

66
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:50,485
What do we store carbohydrates in?

67
00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:51,565
Or as?

68
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:52,485
What form?

69
00:09:53,005 --> 00:09:53,525
Glycogen.

70
00:09:55,206 --> 00:10:05,388
Another large factor to this decrease in carbohydrate utilization as we increase in exercise duration is we are depleting those glycogen stores.

71
00:10:08,597 --> 00:10:15,099
Glycogen depletion during exercise does depend on intensity, but it also is impacted by time.

72
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:24,763
Since we are on the duration piece, we'll kind of focus on the duration for now, but just kind of keep in mind that it works at every single intensity.

73
00:10:25,603 --> 00:10:28,645
So here in these little boxes, we have intensity.

74
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:33,188
So this is 120% of max, 90%, 75, 60, and 30.

75
00:10:33,828 --> 00:10:39,892
And this is glycogen depletion here on the y-axis and then duration or time on the x-axis.

76
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:44,195
We can see that at every intensity it decreases.

77
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:49,627
as far as glycogen content with exercise duration.

78
00:10:50,347 --> 00:10:55,868
But we see the largest magnitude in decrease at the 75% intensity.

79
00:10:57,268 --> 00:11:02,029
But I guess the point is, is as you increase in duration, you are depleting those glycogen stores.

80
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,271
If you run out of glycogen or deplete them to a certain level,

81
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:19,711
you have to rely on other energy stores, which would be this fat utilization over here.

82
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:28,753
Okay.

83
00:11:30,613 --> 00:11:36,374
So this does not change our model of as exercise intensity increases, we prefer carbohydrates.

84
00:11:37,674 --> 00:11:40,815
It's just we're running out of those carbohydrates with duration.

85
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:52,820
This is kind of telling the same story, declining the gas drop muscle for glycogen content for three hours of treadmill exercise running at 70% VO2 max.

86
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:06,247
We see the muscle glycogen decreases, and as we have that decrease in muscle glycogen, it seems like we are working harder, or the perceived exertion here on this y-axis is much higher.

87
00:12:08,804 --> 00:12:20,989
It is interesting though that until about 50 millimoles per kilogram, there wasn't a large or a change in this increase of the rating of perceived exertion.

88
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:30,033
And I think most of us who have exercised for this long of a duration, maybe one hour to two hour, you may have felt this if you weren't feeding.

89
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:37,741
So you're exercising, you're feeling pretty good, and then all of a sudden you're like, whoa, I'm in really bad shape here.

90
00:12:37,861 --> 00:12:38,722
I need to feed.

91
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:45,308
But by that time, you're kind of out of luck, and you have to really decrease that exercise intensity.

92
00:12:45,888 --> 00:12:51,913
Sometimes that's called hitting the wall, or you're bonking, and you really, no matter what, you can try to feed.

93
00:12:51,953 --> 00:12:55,817
But at that point in time, you have to decrease that exercise intensity.

94
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:02,324
Another kind of figure of the same concept.

95
00:13:02,384 --> 00:13:02,624
Oh, yeah.

96
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:06,326
Yeah, yeah.

97
00:13:06,526 --> 00:13:07,747
And we'll talk about feeding.

98
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:12,730
But yeah, as you feed, that really makes a very large difference in this model.

99
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:24,621
Well, if you are supplying carbohydrates, then you can almost spare some of the glycogen molecules.

100
00:13:25,382 --> 00:13:27,983
You can push this curve a little bit further.

101
00:13:28,644 --> 00:13:36,208
So instead of muscle glycogen ending at four hours, maybe it'll end over here at six, but maybe you're not even exercising for six hours.

102
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:38,029
So you would never run into that problem.

103
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:39,410
It's a great question.

104
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:50,721
So here if we have the two major substrates but broken down in kind of locations, we have muscle triglycerides, plasma-free fatty acids, and then blood glucose and muscle glycogen.

105
00:13:51,522 --> 00:14:01,692
So we can think of this 50% here just like what we saw on that previous figure of fat utilization and carbohydrate utilization right around 50-50, because all of this would be carbohydrate.

106
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:17,837
They all decrease here, but as we start to deplete our glycogen levels, we are more and more becoming reliant on our glucose levels, which is generally not a great thing because we need to tightly regulate our blood glucose levels.

107
00:14:18,477 --> 00:14:20,519
But they have to pull that energy from somewhere.

108
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:28,025
No surprise, we're becoming more reliant on the free fatty acids, the plasma free fatty acids.

109
00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:38,216
And so we kind of talked about this a little bit based on your classmates question.

110
00:14:39,437 --> 00:14:46,420
But if muscle glycogen levels are limited during prolonged low intensity exercise, what can an athlete do to delay the fatigue in a race?

111
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:51,743
We don't have to break off into groups because we just kind of talked about it.

112
00:14:53,344 --> 00:14:54,504
But remind me, what can we do?

113
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:55,425
There's a few things.

114
00:14:56,485 --> 00:14:57,926
Yeah, you can feed, right?

115
00:14:58,626 --> 00:15:04,730
You can eat and try to maintain some of these blood glucose and glycogen levels.

116
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,932
What else could we do, but if it's an athlete they really don't wanna do it?

117
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:12,375
Slow down, yeah.

118
00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:22,901
Eventually you can't maintain that exercise intensity, so maybe you have to slow down so you're relying on more fats to produce the energy to sustain that exercise as opposed to carbohydrates.

119
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:24,642
That's good, good.

120
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:33,758
OK, I know I'm just almost repeating the same thing over and over, but this is how important these concepts are.

121
00:15:33,838 --> 00:15:38,140
But again, exercise duration on muscle fuel source.

122
00:15:38,701 --> 00:15:46,565
We start to deplete those glycogen levels, so we need to rely more and more on plasma-free fatty acids.

123
00:15:46,885 --> 00:15:48,186
And that's why this one comes way up.

124
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,111
Okay, so are we kinda stuck where we're at?

125
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:09,436
No, not really, because if we can train or undergo repeated bouts over time of endurance exercise training, we can shift this curve.

126
00:16:10,316 --> 00:16:22,041
And how this curve shifts, if we're just looking at fat oxidation here on the y-axis, so I've kinda taken away carbohydrate to make this a little bit easier to look at, if we start at this bottom curve,

127
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,902
after training, we shift the curve up and to the left.

128
00:16:28,402 --> 00:16:29,863
So up and to the left over here.

129
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,324
So that's what this arrow is indicating.

130
00:16:34,545 --> 00:16:39,607
The nice thing about this would be now I can take any duration

131
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,993
draw a line straight up, so say three hours.

132
00:16:44,193 --> 00:16:49,700
This was my old line and I was at 48% oxidation.

133
00:16:50,221 --> 00:16:53,484
And I come back up to here after training, I'm at 50 or 60, 58, 60% oxidation.

134
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:04,234
So if you're ever like, oh, man, I kind of forgot after training, where does the curve shift?

135
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:14,281
Well, if I drew the curve down below and you just drew a line up, you would see you're burning less fat after training if you drew it incorrectly on the bottom.

136
00:17:14,841 --> 00:17:27,150
And so it's pretty straightforward as far as if you have the underlying concept and you draw the curve correctly, or if you have the curve incorrect and you have the underlying concept, you can correct that pretty quickly.

137
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:37,135
So I think draw the curve, draw a line straight up, and you can kind of see which one is improving after training.

138
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:50,223
Any questions on substrate utilization as we are increasing duration or time?

139
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:52,605
Yeah.

140
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,262
like the output level of the athletes?

141
00:18:03,544 --> 00:18:11,270
So you're saying that as I train, if I'm utilizing more fat, I'm at a disadvantage?

142
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,612
Is that kind of what you're getting at?

143
00:18:14,013 --> 00:18:14,273
Yeah.

144
00:18:14,353 --> 00:18:19,698
So in this instance, one thing, and this is a great question, because we're at the same exercise intensity here.

145
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:25,684
So at the same exercise intensity, we see an increase in fat utilization with training.

146
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:29,787
But that just means with training I can run faster.

147
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:39,990
So then I'd be at a higher absolute speed and I'd be able to maintain the same rate of fat oxidation versus carbohydrate if I push myself on a higher intensity scale.

148
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:48,353
So what this ends up doing is it actually spares your glycogen molecules at a much higher rate for an endurance trained athlete.

149
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:58,876
I guess, like what's the duration of the training like before that?

150
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:06,481
Yeah, it depends a little bit, but most of the studies have six to eight weeks of training and they publish those results.

151
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:14,448
There are individuals who need a little bit less and especially if someone was already endurance trained and then they took a big break and then they went back.

152
00:19:14,868 --> 00:19:17,850
We'll talk about how athletes kind of bounce back a little bit faster.

153
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:23,815
But in general, six to eight weeks would be where the majority of the research lands in this kind of area, yeah.

154
00:19:29,745 --> 00:19:33,487
Well, so when you say switch, they're always utilizing fat.

155
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:40,470
They're just doing it at a higher percentage after training compared to before training at the same exercise intensity.

156
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:48,534
But if you put them at a higher exercise intensity, well, that changes because on that spectrum, you're still going to have an increase in carbohydrate utilization.

157
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:50,235
Great question.

158
00:19:50,435 --> 00:19:52,156
I think there was another one above.

159
00:19:52,476 --> 00:19:53,636
And it's OK if you don't have it again?

160
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:54,597
Yep.

161
00:20:07,548 --> 00:20:14,195
Yeah, so not necessarily aerobic versus anaerobic, but we would almost say the rate of perceived exertion would be lower.

162
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:15,916
It'd feel a little bit easier.

163
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:18,719
And I think we've all experienced this with some sort of training.

164
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,961
You run at five miles per hour every day.

165
00:20:21,562 --> 00:20:27,928
Maybe the first day is kind of hard, but then two months later, you're like, oh, five miles per hour is not that bad anymore.

166
00:20:28,168 --> 00:20:29,810
And so that kind of happens.

167
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:40,214
The whole time, you're still primarily oxidative, as long as you're getting past a certain duration, which we kind of talked about on Tuesday, where that halfway point is around two to three minutes.

168
00:20:41,054 --> 00:20:44,475
After that, you're primarily using oxidative sources.

169
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,076
Yeah, that's good.

170
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:51,136
Okay, great.

171
00:20:51,977 --> 00:20:53,458
Okay, so this is duration.

172
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:57,121
Now let's look at what happens with intensity.

173
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:01,604
We've kind of already talked about this as we were talking about duration.

174
00:21:02,905 --> 00:21:10,971
But for graded exercise, when I say graded exercise, we're talking about an incremental increase in exercise intensity.

175
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:38,102
Just because we are increasing the exercise intensity does not necessarily mean we're talking about anaerobic versus aerobic, but with a lot of these exercise intensities, we are trying to say, well, at least they're exercising for around four to 10 minutes, which is why ATP produced is primarily from aerobic or oxidative metabolism.

176
00:21:41,301 --> 00:22:02,090
Once you reach a certain point where you plateau, which is kind of this next slide here, so as I increase the workload here on the X axis, we are increasing our oxygen consumption on the Y. Well, that makes sense because we need more oxygen to then undergo metabolism to produce more ATP, but eventually,

177
00:22:03,658 --> 00:22:14,189
We reach a point where even if I increase the workload or the power, there's no increase in oxygen consumption.

178
00:22:16,171 --> 00:22:22,698
We'll touch on where the barriers are that are limiting your body's ability to uptake more oxygen.

179
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:33,611
But some of the more easier ones to think about is, well, my lungs are just the size that I have.

180
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:36,093
My heart can't really get that much bigger.

181
00:22:36,253 --> 00:22:38,115
Well, they don't get bigger on the outside.

182
00:22:38,695 --> 00:22:41,117
You can have some hypertrophy inside of the ventricles.

183
00:22:41,878 --> 00:22:45,841
But you have the lungs that you are born with, and you have the heart that you're born with.

184
00:22:45,922 --> 00:22:50,826
And so at a certain point in time, I can't bring enough oxygen in, or maybe I can't pump enough blood.

185
00:22:51,857 --> 00:23:02,703
So those are a couple limitations, but eventually your body cannot absorb or consume more oxygen, no matter the power that I kind of put that individual on.

186
00:23:03,163 --> 00:23:05,505
And so they reach a physiological ceiling.

187
00:23:08,866 --> 00:23:18,292
So some of those factors, maximum ability of cardiorespiratory system to deliver oxygen to the muscles, or the ability of the muscles to use the oxygen and produce ATP aerobically.

188
00:23:19,252 --> 00:23:20,753
So you can imagine if I had

189
00:23:24,047 --> 00:23:34,620
a well-developed heart, lungs, blood, and all of that, but then all of a sudden I take away half your mitochondria, well, that could be a problem for you to actually consume that oxygen.

190
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:37,343
So that's what that bottom one's kind of talking about.

191
00:23:42,538 --> 00:23:46,421
Okay, exercise intensity and fuel selection at low intensity exercise.

192
00:23:46,841 --> 00:23:49,864
Fats are the primary fuel that is being utilized.

193
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:54,628
At high exercise intensity, carbohydrates are the primary fuel.

194
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:03,254
We kinda talked about this before, so this should be a little bit of review, and I think you've seen this in your labs as well.

195
00:24:05,516 --> 00:24:10,280
Which is why I know this question's gonna be on your exam then.

196
00:24:14,342 --> 00:24:19,527
You're going to get 100 here, and we're going to put this on the exam here.

197
00:24:20,388 --> 00:24:24,372
What happens to R or RER as exercise intensity increases?

198
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:21,328
OK, let's go maybe 30, 45 seconds more.

199
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:27,391
Does anyone need more help setting this up or setting your clicker up?

200
00:25:50,593 --> 00:25:51,773
All right, 30 more seconds.

201
00:25:52,113 --> 00:25:53,654
Make sure you have something clicked in.

202
00:25:53,674 --> 00:26:08,738
All right, 10 seconds here.

203
00:26:08,758 --> 00:26:16,760
I'll close this down in three, two, one.

204
00:26:21,565 --> 00:26:23,346
All right, so I'm gonna show this.

205
00:26:29,608 --> 00:26:30,349
We did pretty good.

206
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:31,729
I'll take that.

207
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:40,333
I know some of you were like, oh, 86%, if there was an 86% average on the exam, oh man, I'd throw everyone a party in here.

208
00:26:40,453 --> 00:26:41,993
Like, I'd take that all day long.

209
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:47,296
So don't worry, 86, yeah, that's not 100, but I'm okay with that.

210
00:26:47,436 --> 00:26:48,096
That's pretty good.

211
00:26:48,596 --> 00:26:49,877
Let's talk about this really quick.

212
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:56,820
Right, if I increase exercise intensity, what are we trying to utilize more of?

213
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,101
Carbs, yep, just like what we talked about.

214
00:27:00,602 --> 00:27:05,805
On the RER chart, if I'm at 100% carbohydrate, what's that RER value?

215
00:27:06,785 --> 00:27:08,226
One, and then if I'm at 100% fat, what are we at?

216
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,580
0.7, good.

217
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:23,006
So if we look at this chart over here, and if I'm moving from 0% carbohydrate to 100, we're getting closer to ones who are increasing the RER.

218
00:27:26,327 --> 00:27:39,313
Okay, so as carbohydrates are increasing with exercise intensity and fats are kind of decreasing, well eventually you're gonna have these two lines kind of cross, which you can kind of imply from this table right here.

219
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:46,435
Where these two lines cross is called the crossover concept.

220
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:59,382
So this, pretty much this crossover point is the point at which our body switches over from primarily fat oxidation to primarily carbohydrate oxidation.

221
00:28:03,043 --> 00:28:06,085
As soon as we kind of move over from here,

222
00:28:08,111 --> 00:28:12,815
Then again, we can kind of tell in individuals maybe at a certain intensity point.

223
00:28:15,717 --> 00:28:22,163
So the next question you might ask yourself, what's causing this crossover concept or this crossover to occur?

224
00:28:23,664 --> 00:28:24,845
Well, there are a few things.

225
00:28:25,646 --> 00:28:27,107
We're gonna go over two of them.

226
00:28:27,527 --> 00:28:32,672
One would be the recruitment of fast muscle fibers that are better equipped to metabolize carbohydrates than fats.

227
00:28:39,124 --> 00:28:48,714
No.

228
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:50,255
We're gonna get into that in a second.

229
00:28:50,335 --> 00:28:51,917
Yeah, can we hold on to that thought?

230
00:28:52,057 --> 00:28:52,818
Okay, cool, cool.

231
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:58,092
OK, so recruitment of different muscle fibers.

232
00:28:58,392 --> 00:28:59,313
And we'll get into this.

233
00:28:59,353 --> 00:29:07,538
But if you remember from anatomy, you're kind of shifting from that type 1 to type 2 fiber recruitment as you are increasing exercise intensity.

234
00:29:07,978 --> 00:29:11,120
And so we start to rely more on carbohydrates for that.

235
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:16,695
You also have increasing blood levels of epinephrine to stimulate glycogenolysis.

236
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:26,818
So very similar to what we saw with exercise duration, epinephrine and norepinephrine also increase with intensity.

237
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:34,260
So epinephrine and norepinephrine both increase with intensity and duration.

238
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,682
The magnitude is a little bit different, but don't worry about which one's more or which one's less.

239
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:42,622
They just both increase, yeah.

240
00:29:55,444 --> 00:29:58,625
Yeah, yeah, so you're bringing up a really great question.

241
00:29:58,705 --> 00:30:04,786
So if we have an increase in epinephrine, we just talked about how that's going to help with breakdown of triglycerides.

242
00:30:05,426 --> 00:30:06,466
Hang on to that thought.

243
00:30:06,486 --> 00:30:07,967
We're going to touch into that.

244
00:30:08,127 --> 00:30:09,147
Well, I guess we can.

245
00:30:12,276 --> 00:30:15,959
Where do we store most of our adipose tissue?

246
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:21,883
You don't have to say like exact location, but in the muscle or not in the muscle?

247
00:30:22,564 --> 00:30:23,284
Not in the muscle.

248
00:30:23,945 --> 00:30:28,148
When you are increasing exercise intensity, where do you want to send most of the blood?

249
00:30:29,622 --> 00:30:49,875
to the muscle and so as you increase in exercise intensity, you start to divert a lot of the blood to the muscle and so that's less blood flow to going to the liver or some of the adipose tissue and so it actually reduces or blunts some of the ability for you to sequester some of the triglycerides or free fatty acids from the triglycerides.

250
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:53,758
But we'll touch on a few other mechanisms that are kind of impairing with that later.

251
00:30:57,033 --> 00:31:02,075
OK, so influence on exercise intensity on muscle fuel source.

252
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:07,797
This is very similar to the figure we saw with the four kind of lines going out on that grid.

253
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:11,639
Here we have exercise intensity 25, 65, and 85, the percent of fuel source used.

254
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:23,284
We can see that plasma-free fatty acids are the primary energy source at these lower exercise intensities, like 25%.

255
00:31:24,945 --> 00:31:29,607
But as we increase in that exercise intensity, they start to get lower and lower and lower.

256
00:31:30,448 --> 00:31:35,290
And what we start to rely more and more on would be the muscle glycogen, which is this top blue bar.

257
00:31:35,631 --> 00:31:41,714
So as we increase in exercise intensity, we're increasing the utilization from glycogen.

258
00:31:47,975 --> 00:32:01,441
Just like fat oxidation as you increase the duration with training, you can shift the crossover concept as well with exercise intensity.

259
00:32:03,141 --> 00:32:09,084
So for this, if we have this fat oxidation here in this dark line,

260
00:32:09,939 --> 00:32:15,260
And then this dotted line over here, we have the carbohydrate utilization.

261
00:32:16,281 --> 00:32:19,841
With training, you shift the crossover point to the right.

262
00:32:22,822 --> 00:32:30,624
So it doesn't have it necessarily here, but if you go back to the other figure, the crossover point was around 30% to 40%.

263
00:32:31,944 --> 00:32:35,005
And then with training, you push it kind of to the right.

264
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:47,443
And if I'm just looking at the estimated kind of R over here, no surprise, the R kind of shifts down and to the right.

265
00:32:52,521 --> 00:33:07,664
I like this curve a little bit better because you can draw one crossover concept, then draw an arrow to the right, maybe draw another crossover to that, and then you can see, well, how many carbohydrates or fat am I using at 60%?

266
00:33:08,624 --> 00:33:16,126
Well, this is around 40% over here, but if the old crossover was down here, then it would be closer to 20%.

267
00:33:20,825 --> 00:33:31,268
So the whole name of the game, then, would be both scenarios you're trying to oxidize or use more fat at higher intensities so that you can spare those glycogen molecules.

268
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:50,233
Interestingly, regardless if you are trained or untrained, this crossover concept occurs really close to something called the lactate threshold.

269
00:33:51,568 --> 00:33:53,189
So that'll be our next concept here.

270
00:33:55,091 --> 00:33:59,935
Before I move on to this, are we okay with exercise intensity and substrate utilization?

271
00:34:02,337 --> 00:34:09,323
Anytime you see a problem that deals with substrate utilization, you need to almost like box off two concepts, duration and intensity.

272
00:34:10,525 --> 00:34:17,551
Once you have those two concepts kind of written or kind of straightened out, then you can try to answer the question.

273
00:34:18,548 --> 00:34:30,195
Because if you mix the two together and you try to apply, like you say, oh, as I increase with exercise duration, now I'm getting carbohydrate utilization to go up, well, that would be a problem.

274
00:34:30,255 --> 00:34:34,958
So just make sure you separate the two and then you look at them a little bit more separate.

275
00:34:36,238 --> 00:34:45,584
Yes, they kind of happen at the same time, but at least for this course, we're really gonna assess you on whether you can identify duration versus intensity.

276
00:34:49,497 --> 00:34:50,497
Okay, lactate threshold.

277
00:34:52,418 --> 00:35:07,220
Just to kind of bring you back over here, if we're in this space where we're looking at glycolysis and we're producing a little bit of pyruvate, that pyruvate kind of bounces into lactate dehydrogenase and then we get lactate.

278
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,661
I like to start with this.

279
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:15,622
You will not need to know these different terms.

280
00:35:16,564 --> 00:35:22,487
but there are a lot of terms out there when trying to describe this concept.

281
00:35:24,048 --> 00:35:32,572
Anaerobic threshold, onset of blood lactate accumulation, onset of plasma lactate accumulation, maximal steady state, critical power, lactate break point.

282
00:35:33,213 --> 00:35:35,734
There are a ton of researchers that use different terms.

283
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:43,098
The reason why I like to put this up here is because depending on the paper or the book that you read, you could see one of these things.

284
00:35:44,138 --> 00:35:51,821
They all generally are referring to the same concept, but sometimes they kind of put them on different spectrums as far as intensity.

285
00:35:52,521 --> 00:35:58,524
So there's another one on here that's like one millimolar above lactate break point, things like that.

286
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:02,385
So this is just more for your information.

287
00:36:02,425 --> 00:36:04,586
Don't worry, you'll never be tested on this.

288
00:36:05,026 --> 00:36:11,709
Just know that people set the lactate threshold at different lactate concentrations or powers.

289
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,401
Okay, so lactate threshold.

290
00:36:15,441 --> 00:36:21,006
This is the work rate at which blood lactate rises systematically during a graded exercise test.

291
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:39,884
What that means is if I have an exercise intensity down on the x-axis, whether that's in relative or absolute, so speed versus percent VO2 max, and then on the y we have lactate concentration, as I increase the intensity,

292
00:36:42,188 --> 00:36:49,792
your blood lactate actually does not change as the workloads are getting harder to a certain point.

293
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:56,055
Then at that point, you start to get a systematic rise in blood lactate.

294
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:59,157
So that's this inflection point here.

295
00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:09,042
Typically, we see this around 50 to 60% VO2 max in untrained individuals.

296
00:37:10,335 --> 00:37:12,736
and then we see it a little bit higher in trained subjects.

297
00:37:14,176 --> 00:37:28,822
This is the average range here, but we have sampled lactate or lactate levels or lactate threshold in the United States Olympic development team, like the runners, and some of them are in the low 90s, like 92%.

298
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:37,035
And so what they are trying to do is they're trying to push this threshold as far to the right as possible.

299
00:37:37,776 --> 00:37:42,320
So this blue line would be trained individuals and the red line would be the untrained individuals.

300
00:37:43,301 --> 00:37:54,251
So they're trying to push this as far to the right as possible so they can maintain this flat lactate concentration for higher intensities.

301
00:37:59,465 --> 00:38:13,731
Okay, so hopefully you're okay with this concept and the next question in the back of your mind might be like, okay, well, this is nice to see that we have this flat piece, but what's actually causing the increase in this lactate concentration?

302
00:38:15,692 --> 00:38:18,593
Here are some potential mechanisms to explain the lactate threshold.

303
00:38:20,414 --> 00:38:22,895
One would be low muscle glycogen.

304
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:26,517
I'm gonna try to emphasize as best as I can.

305
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,641
This is not well accepted.

306
00:38:31,322 --> 00:38:38,466
There are probably only a few people out there as far as like exercise physiologists that actually believe this is true.

307
00:38:39,707 --> 00:38:47,731
The reason why it's still here on this chart though is because some people still have this idea that it's due to low muscle oxygen.

308
00:38:47,751 --> 00:38:49,532
And we'll get into that in just a little bit.

309
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,022
The next would be accelerated glycolysis.

310
00:38:54,583 --> 00:39:02,649
No surprise if I'm creating more pyruvate while I'm increasing the chances that pyruvate's gonna bump into that enzyme and get converted to lactate.

311
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,510
Seems reasonable to me.

312
00:39:05,231 --> 00:39:10,015
Recruitment of fast-twitch fibers, that also seems reasonable to me.

313
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:20,083
But that doesn't necessarily tell me whether, all these are telling me is that I'm increasing in the lactate production.

314
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:28,333
What we need to kind of keep in the back of our mind is, our body actually uptakes lactate.

315
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:38,317
If we just had these three pieces here, then we wouldn't see this one.

316
00:39:40,018 --> 00:39:47,821
Because at every single one of these intensities here, especially for the train one, glycolysis is increasing at every single one of these points.

317
00:39:48,758 --> 00:39:50,739
And you are recruiting more fast-twitch fibers.

318
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:52,859
So you are producing more lactate.

319
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,961
But you're still not getting an increase in lactate concentration here.

320
00:40:00,242 --> 00:40:05,664
And so what we need to keep in the back of our mind is that we actually remove lactate from the blood.

321
00:40:06,744 --> 00:40:09,686
And another piece could be a reduced rate of lactate removal.

322
00:40:12,106 --> 00:40:16,268
If you take all of this as kind of in total,

323
00:40:18,217 --> 00:40:21,139
This is the take home message that you should probably look at.

324
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:34,830
Blood lactate concentration is just this formula of rate of appearance minus the rate of disappearance or the rate of removal.

325
00:40:36,412 --> 00:40:38,393
How much are you putting into the blood?

326
00:40:39,234 --> 00:40:40,955
And then how much are you taking out?

327
00:40:42,577 --> 00:40:45,339
At these lower intensities, you're almost at like zero.

328
00:40:47,985 --> 00:40:53,267
So that's the biggest thing we need to kind of keep in mind of what's causing the lactate threshold.

329
00:40:54,908 --> 00:41:01,291
I don't know specifically if I'm removing less or just producing more.

330
00:41:02,912 --> 00:41:17,458
So if you think of like a bucket of water and I turn on a faucet to fill up the bucket and then I poke a hole in the bottom, well if I match the rate that the bucket is losing water with the faucet, the water level should not change.

331
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:22,155
But if I turn on the faucet more, yeah, you're gonna get an accumulation of that water.

332
00:41:23,196 --> 00:41:30,601
Or instead of turning on the faucet and just leave the faucet at the same rate, I make the hole a little bit bigger or smaller, that will change the water level.

333
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:39,086
So I don't know, we don't know as researchers if it's the rate of removal versus the rate of production.

334
00:41:42,328 --> 00:41:45,090
And it does depend on the individual as well as the type of exercise.

335
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:51,712
All we know is it's this kind of rate of removal versus the rate of appearance.

336
00:41:56,636 --> 00:42:00,218
We don't need to break out into a group, but this is kind of just a fun thing.

337
00:42:00,298 --> 00:42:02,940
How do we actually get this?

338
00:42:03,401 --> 00:42:07,143
How do we measure blood lactate levels over time during graded exercise tests?

339
00:42:07,624 --> 00:42:10,586
Maybe some of you have already done it, but any ideas?

340
00:42:13,808 --> 00:42:13,928
Yeah.

341
00:42:15,553 --> 00:42:16,874
Yeah, you do a little finger stick.

342
00:42:17,655 --> 00:42:21,498
Sometimes you can actually poke the back of the earlobe.

343
00:42:22,299 --> 00:42:23,480
That one's a little bit easier.

344
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,322
And some people are like, oh, I don't know if I like that.

345
00:42:25,362 --> 00:42:31,087
But for cycling, if your hands are on the handlebars, well, it's a little bit easier to access the ear.

346
00:42:33,128 --> 00:42:37,052
For running, typically we have them kind of put their hand out on the treadmill.

347
00:42:37,532 --> 00:42:38,313
We just poke the finger.

348
00:42:42,503 --> 00:42:48,907
The nice thing about this is if I can get someone's lactate threshold, we can do some pretty cool stuff.

349
00:42:48,987 --> 00:42:52,149
We can predict endurance performance pretty well.

350
00:42:53,630 --> 00:43:03,916
We do need to combine this with running economy and some of the better predictions also include things like kinetics, critical power, as well as VO2 max.

351
00:43:05,557 --> 00:43:08,879
The other nice thing would be we can plan some training programs.

352
00:43:10,413 --> 00:43:21,539
If the idea is let's push the lactate threshold to the right as far as possible, well then we need to spend the most amount of our training inside of that lactate threshold range.

353
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:28,983
So a little bit above, maybe right at it to try to push that curve and stress the body to get it to move to the right.

354
00:43:33,857 --> 00:43:39,600
You'll be working with this formula in lab, so I won't spend too much time with this.

355
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:55,446
But essentially, your 10K race time does a really good job for your ability to run 10 kilometers is very closely linked to where your lactate threshold occurs as far as pacing.

356
00:43:56,547 --> 00:43:59,048
So we can then predict performance in 10K race.

357
00:43:59,108 --> 00:44:01,069
We need to determine the lactate threshold.

358
00:44:02,325 --> 00:44:03,846
And then we can measure VO2 max.

359
00:44:05,147 --> 00:44:13,735
We input these into a different formula that you won't be responsible for, but we can estimate the 10K running time using this formula here.

360
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,100
So what does that look like?

361
00:44:20,421 --> 00:44:24,543
Okay, well, we'll draw kind of one line over this way on the lactate threshold.

362
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:33,267
So if you have oxygen uptake or intensity on the X axis and then blood lactate on the Y, we draw one line to establish that baseline lactate.

363
00:44:33,807 --> 00:44:36,869
And then once we see that systematic rise, we'll draw another line.

364
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:44,553
And wherever those points intersect, we pretty much drop that towards the intensity and we know where their lactate threshold is around.

365
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:49,493
You will not be taking lactate samples in lab.

366
00:44:50,173 --> 00:44:54,957
We'll instead use something called the ventilatory threshold, which behaves very similarly.

367
00:44:56,738 --> 00:45:01,902
It's not a direct measure of lactate threshold, but it gives us a good idea of where lactate threshold might be around.

368
00:45:03,843 --> 00:45:05,585
And then you can plug in these values here.

369
00:45:06,105 --> 00:45:11,909
And then for this particular individual, we are predicting them to finish the 10K time in about 48.78 minutes.

370
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,122
Any questions on this?

371
00:45:24,329 --> 00:45:25,290
All right, nice.

372
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:32,302
So then we get into this next concept about lactate.

373
00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:34,269
and fatigue.

374
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:44,854
How many of you have heard that lactate is either some sort of contributor or influencing an individual's to fatigue?

375
00:45:44,894 --> 00:45:48,435
So lactate causes fatigue, lactate causes soreness or discomfort, right?

376
00:45:48,455 --> 00:45:50,616
We've all probably heard that term before.

377
00:45:52,137 --> 00:45:56,299
So then, what could we do then to test this?

378
00:45:59,397 --> 00:46:03,360
What's like the most extreme example as to how we could test this?

379
00:46:05,622 --> 00:46:13,709
Yeah, you could inject lactate, but then you wouldn't know though that maybe still the lower concentrations are still contributing.

380
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:21,415
What's the extreme way, we can't really do this, but what's the extreme way on the reverse side of that?

381
00:46:28,884 --> 00:46:33,665
Yeah, so what if we just eliminated lactate production altogether?

382
00:46:33,685 --> 00:46:36,546
Well, that seems pretty nice, right?

383
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:50,569
Because if I eliminate lactate production at all from exercise, then they shouldn't have any type of fatigue, and they shouldn't have the muscle soreness or the burning, right?

384
00:46:50,889 --> 00:46:52,850
That seems reasonable, but we can't do that.

385
00:46:53,896 --> 00:46:54,456
Or can we?

386
00:46:54,976 --> 00:46:55,496
No, we can't.

387
00:46:55,796 --> 00:46:58,697
But there is something called McArdle's disease.

388
00:46:59,717 --> 00:47:03,738
So McArdle's disease is a very interesting genetic mutation.

389
00:47:04,658 --> 00:47:19,021
So there's an error in the muscle glycogen where these individuals cannot synthesize the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, which means they cannot break down glycogen and glycolysis does not occur.

390
00:47:20,802 --> 00:47:20,942
Whoa.

391
00:47:22,292 --> 00:47:29,035
That's a tough deal for them, but this gave researchers a pretty interesting idea.

392
00:47:29,755 --> 00:47:36,938
What if we check these lactate levels and see what happens during exercise?

393
00:47:37,579 --> 00:47:44,422
So here on this top curve, we have blood lactate, and then we have percent of relative VO2 max.

394
00:47:45,702 --> 00:47:52,343
The dark or the solid lines are McArdle's patients and the dotted lines are controls, normal healthy controls.

395
00:47:54,504 --> 00:48:04,906
As we increase exercise intensity all the way to 100, no surprise that the levels of lactate do not change in these McArdle's patients.

396
00:48:05,846 --> 00:48:08,387
But the controls do have a lactate threshold.

397
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:13,188
Nice, at least the experimental model worked.

398
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:22,075
We're seeing no change in lactate in these Mercadil's patients, but we're seeing an exponential increase in lactate concentration in the controls.

399
00:48:23,436 --> 00:48:25,777
Well, maybe something else was going on with ventilation.

400
00:48:25,897 --> 00:48:28,459
No, they're still having an increase in ventilation.

401
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,920
So there's an excess buildup of hydrogen ions.

402
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,603
They're undergoing the bicarb buffering system, and they're having some hyperventilation.

403
00:48:37,724 --> 00:48:41,447
And they also see the same in controls.

404
00:48:44,623 --> 00:48:53,071
But, McCardell's patients, they do not tolerate exercise very well.

405
00:48:54,091 --> 00:49:07,924
There's a big issue with these individuals or these patients that the main complaint during any type of exercise activity is the soreness, the burning, and the fatigue.

406
00:49:10,215 --> 00:49:21,749
So it's quite interesting that they are experiencing the same issues that we experience albeit at a lower intensity with no lactate.

407
00:49:23,534 --> 00:49:27,677
There's also those pieces where we talked about, I think someone had mentioned infusing lactate.

408
00:49:27,977 --> 00:49:32,600
Well, if I infuse lactate at a higher concentration, it's not like our whole body starts to burn.

409
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:38,824
And then someone can argue, well, maybe it's because there's a higher lactate concentration inside of the muscle compared to the blood.

410
00:49:38,844 --> 00:49:41,305
And that's true, but then you still can't get past this.

411
00:49:48,249 --> 00:49:52,132
So then if they can't break down carbohydrate sources, what are they using?

412
00:49:54,553 --> 00:49:56,434
to do the exercise or any type of activity.

413
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,616
There's only one other option.

414
00:50:00,216 --> 00:50:00,956
Fats, right?

415
00:50:00,976 --> 00:50:07,159
So not surprisingly, McArdle's patients use more fat as a fuel compared to control subjects during submaximal exercise.

416
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:10,041
However, this is pretty interesting.

417
00:50:11,121 --> 00:50:17,644
Despite the rising levels of fatty acids in the blood, McArdle's patients are not able to oxidize more fat.

418
00:50:18,825 --> 00:50:19,065
What?

419
00:50:19,085 --> 00:50:20,566
What's going on?

420
00:50:21,621 --> 00:50:24,904
These poor micartos patients, they're just struggling the whole way through.

421
00:50:26,625 --> 00:50:36,333
This introduced this idea of how fats need to burn in the flame of a carbohydrate.

422
00:50:37,254 --> 00:50:42,799
So carbohydrate availability limits fat oxidation even during steady state exercise in these patients.

423
00:50:43,459 --> 00:50:47,182
The idea is that if you reduce

424
00:50:48,433 --> 00:50:51,914
some of the important substrates of the Krebs cycle.

425
00:50:52,094 --> 00:51:00,158
So maybe you're not just producing some of the four carbons in a higher quantity when you're burning carbohydrates as opposed to only fats.

426
00:51:00,538 --> 00:51:06,340
And you start limiting the ability to produce or run through the Krebs cycle.

427
00:51:07,889 --> 00:51:13,511
And so this idea that fats must burn in the flame of carbohydrates came from these researchers.

428
00:51:14,331 --> 00:51:21,273
So glycogen is depleted during prolonged high-intensity exercise, and so we're reducing the rate of glycolysis and production of pyruvate.

429
00:51:21,753 --> 00:51:24,994
You're also reducing a lot of the Krebs cycle intermediaries.

430
00:51:25,635 --> 00:51:31,336
So alpha-ketoglutaric acid might be in high demand, but low availability.

431
00:51:32,037 --> 00:51:36,538
And that overall, this idea is you're reducing fat oxidation.

432
00:51:42,445 --> 00:51:54,393
This isn't like, there's still a lot of research that needs to go on in this area to really confirm whether this is happening, but the theory seems reasonable.

433
00:51:57,935 --> 00:51:58,656
Any questions here?

434
00:52:00,577 --> 00:52:00,877
Okay.

435
00:52:03,259 --> 00:52:05,080
So then that gets us into another one, right?

436
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,742
We're gonna tackle a few things all today.

437
00:52:09,183 --> 00:52:10,064
Lactate threshold.

438
00:52:11,137 --> 00:52:13,158
We're having trouble burning fat.

439
00:52:15,378 --> 00:52:18,639
We're going to talk about this concept called the fat burning zone.

440
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:23,320
There's no right or wrong answer.

441
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,521
Well, there is a right or wrong answer.

442
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:31,283
But just answer maybe what you previously thought or what you currently believe now.

443
00:52:33,272 --> 00:52:34,574
This is a low stakes question.

444
00:52:34,774 --> 00:52:40,502
As you increase exercise intensity, you shift from primarily burning fats to burning carbohydrates.

445
00:52:41,102 --> 00:52:44,867
Therefore, to lose the most weight, you should exercise at low intensities.

446
00:52:45,608 --> 00:52:46,469
True or false?

447
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:50,455
Feel free to discuss with your classmates and we'll take like a minute.

448
00:53:56,716 --> 00:53:58,737
Okay, let's go maybe 30 more seconds.

449
00:53:58,817 --> 00:54:00,117
Double check you have an answer in.

450
00:54:00,558 --> 00:54:02,498
We're missing I think like 15 clickers here.

451
00:54:02,518 --> 00:54:09,581
There we go, five more.

452
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:24,227
Okay, I'll close this down in three, two, one.

453
00:54:29,842 --> 00:54:40,187
Okay, I like showing this poll here because it used to be like maybe 70, 30 on this end.

454
00:54:40,827 --> 00:54:45,149
So maybe this isn't as much of a myth as once thought.

455
00:54:45,529 --> 00:54:46,569
But can I get some ideas?

456
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:48,130
So what are we thinking here?

457
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:51,271
So it's a safe space, it's okay if you put yes or no.

458
00:54:52,172 --> 00:54:52,912
Tell me what you're thinking.

459
00:55:05,129 --> 00:55:09,376
Yeah, yeah, and where did that come from, I guess, because of this top concept?

460
00:55:11,139 --> 00:55:12,181
Yeah, no, I would agree.

461
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:16,589
Any counter arguments to that?

462
00:55:17,808 --> 00:55:37,660
if you're trying to use cardio to lose weight, even though the percentages of carbs to fat or calories being burned might be or fats to carbs might be higher at lower intensities, you're going to end up burning more calories regardless at a higher intensity.

463
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,582
So you might as well just do higher intensity.

464
00:55:41,392 --> 00:55:43,254
Yeah, yeah, no, I like that thought too.

465
00:55:43,314 --> 00:55:55,506
So it's basically, even though you're getting a larger contribution from fats at a lower intensity, so a higher percent, if you exercise at a higher intensity, you're getting an increase in total energy expenditure.

466
00:55:55,746 --> 00:55:56,867
So I really like that one.

467
00:55:57,788 --> 00:56:01,372
But the true piece, you're not alone.

468
00:56:03,424 --> 00:56:07,466
How many, this is even in your textbook, how many of you have seen this before?

469
00:56:08,106 --> 00:56:18,511
If you want to lose weight, in particular, burn fat, fat burning, you need to stay in the light to very light zone.

470
00:56:19,551 --> 00:56:30,456
We need to be in the low intensity to maximize the fat oxidation or the fat burning, which brought us into this fat burning zone myth.

471
00:56:31,456 --> 00:56:32,337
Where did they get this?

472
00:56:33,934 --> 00:56:36,376
from probably what most of you are thinking right here.

473
00:56:36,956 --> 00:56:50,928
If I look at this teal curve, if I wanna burn the most fat as far as a percent here, just looking at this curve, if someone showed me this curve, I would say I need to be at the lowest intensity to burn the most fat.

474
00:56:53,850 --> 00:57:02,337
But that's not necessarily what ends up happening because if I am walking around campus for an hour,

475
00:57:04,343 --> 00:57:05,563
and I burn 100 calories.

476
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:15,065
Maybe 99% of the calories of the 100 are coming from fat, right?

477
00:57:15,185 --> 00:57:19,646
That seems great, but what if I ran or jogged around campus for an hour?

478
00:57:21,126 --> 00:57:33,048
Well, now I'm burning maybe 600 calories, and even though I'm only taking 50%, well, that 50% is from a larger piece of a pie, so now I'm burning 300 calories from fat.

479
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:44,963
And so we'll get into this here, where at low intensities, say 20% VO2 max, maybe the total energy expenditure is three kcals per minute.

480
00:57:46,544 --> 00:57:53,446
If the R or the RER is 0.8, 67% of the energy is coming from fat.

481
00:57:54,346 --> 00:58:01,408
So a higher fat oxidation compared to a carbohydrate oxidation.

482
00:58:02,605 --> 00:58:09,509
Let's take some time, not too long, but let's calculate how many kcals are gonna come from fat here.

483
00:58:09,729 --> 00:58:10,830
It shouldn't take you too long.

484
00:58:11,551 --> 00:58:14,272
And then calculate how many kcals are coming from carbohydrates.

485
00:58:15,313 --> 00:58:16,454
So let's spend a couple minutes.

486
00:58:16,974 --> 00:58:21,857
It'll be a relatively straightforward calculation here, but let's just do that really fast.

487
00:59:40,075 --> 00:59:41,298
Okay, how are we doing with this one?

488
00:59:41,819 --> 00:59:42,160
Pretty good?

489
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:47,311
You're just pretty much doing 67% of the total, right?

490
00:59:48,614 --> 00:59:48,995
And then, okay.

491
00:59:51,428 --> 00:59:52,829
So we're at 20% VO2 max.

492
00:59:52,849 --> 00:59:56,490
We'll go over these calculations in a bit, but we're gonna try one more.

493
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,491
20% VO2 max, three kcal per minute.

494
00:59:58,991 --> 01:00:06,974
If I bump us up to 60% VO2 max, nine kcal per minute, and we get an R of .9, 33% energy from fat.

495
01:00:07,014 --> 01:00:11,876
Let's calculate how many kcal per minute are coming from fat and carbohydrates.

496
01:00:12,356 --> 01:00:14,017
And these are real numbers here, right?

497
01:00:14,797 --> 01:00:17,058
You will all see these numbers yourselves

498
01:00:18,642 --> 01:00:21,880
Well, not all of you, but whoever's volunteering to exercise next week.

499
01:01:01,412 --> 01:01:03,854
OK, don't worry if you're not there yet.

500
01:01:04,114 --> 01:01:14,240
But on that first one, was it like 67% of your carb, 67% of the energy that you just expended are coming from fats.

501
01:01:14,841 --> 01:01:16,682
Around how many kcal per minute would that be?

502
01:01:18,902 --> 01:01:19,182
Say again?

503
01:01:19,883 --> 01:01:20,683
Close to two, right?

504
01:01:21,223 --> 01:01:21,464
Yeah.

505
01:01:21,764 --> 01:01:31,970
So if you just took this, I know it's not exactly, but yeah, around 67 times 3, we're getting 2 kcals per minute from fat and 1 kcal per minute from carbohydrates.

506
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:43,097
No one's going to argue that this lower intensity had a higher fat oxidation rate from a relative standpoint, the percentage.

507
01:01:45,166 --> 01:01:52,888
And then same deal, no one's gonna argue that as you increase exercise intensity, you're gonna have a decrease in the relative contribution from fat.

508
01:01:53,868 --> 01:01:58,430
But look at that, three Kcal per minute from fat versus two.

509
01:02:01,971 --> 01:02:03,471
Web of lies, right?

510
01:02:03,711 --> 01:02:05,852
We've just been fed all these lies, they're all lies.

511
01:02:06,132 --> 01:02:07,092
Just kidding, no, it's okay.

512
01:02:07,792 --> 01:02:08,832
Why is this happening?

513
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:14,214
Well, if you were to actually plot this at every single exercise intensity,

514
01:02:15,366 --> 01:02:19,675
we actually get into something called the maximum fat oxidation rate.

515
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:25,115
There are a lot of athletes that we build these curves for.

516
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:30,980
This is something that athletes do like, and sometimes people who are undergoing any type of exercise training program.

517
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:48,435
We can actually look and see if this here, this on the left y-axis is R, or RER, on the right is the absolute, so grams per minute fat oxidation here on the right y-axis.

518
01:02:50,179 --> 01:02:52,701
And then on the bottom here we have exercise intensity.

519
01:02:54,242 --> 01:03:14,237
As we increase in exercise intensity, the absolute fat oxidation rate increases up to a certain point where the exercise intensity starts to have such a small contribution from fat that we actually start to decrease in this fat oxidation rate.

520
01:03:16,779 --> 01:03:17,459
So I guess the,

521
01:03:18,822 --> 01:03:30,912
Moral of the story with this one is, well, there are some exercise intensities that are too high to have a high absolute fat oxidation rate, and some of them are too low.

522
01:03:33,014 --> 01:03:44,543
We need to kind of build this curve to find where that maximum fat oxidation rate is to try to capture in how much, or if someone is really trying to burn the most amount of fat.

523
01:03:49,012 --> 01:03:50,973
So this is pretty good, right?

524
01:03:51,053 --> 01:03:53,914
OK, I need to be maybe around 60%.

525
01:03:56,836 --> 01:04:01,598
Interestingly enough, that also occurs very close to one's lactate threshold.

526
01:04:03,238 --> 01:04:12,843
So at 60% intensity, you are actually burning the most fat compared to any other intensity in this given example here.

527
01:04:15,804 --> 01:04:16,984
All right, so maybe you're thinking, man,

528
01:04:19,799 --> 01:04:30,423
Are we really towing the line here between maximum fat oxidation from here to here because we're looking at point three versus point four?

529
01:04:31,643 --> 01:04:36,505
Well, yeah, that could add up over multiple sessions as you are exercising.

530
01:04:37,946 --> 01:04:39,046
Here's the other part.

531
01:04:39,806 --> 01:04:40,727
This is the nice part.

532
01:04:42,347 --> 01:04:46,589
Not only do you burn more fat during exercise,

533
01:04:47,828 --> 01:04:51,009
that you actually burn more after exercise.

534
01:04:53,170 --> 01:05:03,214
So this is the post-exercise resting metabolic rate, RMR, and how it becomes elevated after higher intensity exercise.

535
01:05:04,014 --> 01:05:07,095
So we're looking at 80 minutes of high intensity cycling.

536
01:05:09,256 --> 01:05:12,957
If I'm looking at different exercise intensity down here, so 30%, 50%, and 75%,

537
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:24,238
And we're looking at, on the right side here, caloric expenditure post exercise.

538
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:28,121
So don't worry too much about this black curve.

539
01:05:28,201 --> 01:05:30,483
This is just telling us how long it was elevated.

540
01:05:31,024 --> 01:05:34,607
Well, I guess that is pretty nice because that's 10 hours after exercise.

541
01:05:34,667 --> 01:05:43,015
But after all of that, just during rest, so they undergo 80 minutes of high intensity exercise,

542
01:05:44,248 --> 01:05:48,991
and then you take them off the bike and you lay them and have them quietly rest or sleep.

543
01:05:50,151 --> 01:06:01,117
You measure the caloric expenditure during rest and they are burning 151 calories after exercise compared to 7 and 29 at 30 and 50%.

544
01:06:03,919 --> 01:06:10,242
When I am resting, what percent would you say I would be utilizing from fat?

545
01:06:12,483 --> 01:06:15,444
around, we don't need an exact number, but 100.

546
01:06:15,564 --> 01:06:18,466
I'd say like 99.9, but yeah, 100, right?

547
01:06:18,486 --> 01:06:24,168
150 of those 151 calories are coming from fat.

548
01:06:25,088 --> 01:06:31,051
So not only did you burn more during exercise, but you start burning more after exercise.

549
01:06:33,512 --> 01:06:34,612
Whoa, right?

550
01:06:34,632 --> 01:06:35,433
That's pretty cool.

551
01:06:36,953 --> 01:06:37,954
So why is this happening?

552
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:46,648
Well there's something that we need to look at which is the kind of epoch exercise post-oxygen consumption.

553
01:06:49,129 --> 01:06:55,373
Oxygen uptake remains elevated above rest while we are recovering from exercise.

554
01:06:56,994 --> 01:07:02,957
That again is called excess post-exercise oxygen consumption

555
01:07:07,402 --> 01:07:17,986
So previously termed as oxygen depth, sometimes you'll hear this term, but we don't really use that term for epoch anymore because we put it at the start of exercise basically.

556
01:07:19,207 --> 01:07:23,369
This means the O2 consumed is greater than the O2 demand.

557
01:07:24,509 --> 01:07:28,191
We have two separate portions that we're gonna talk about here in the next slide.

558
01:07:28,971 --> 01:07:30,872
It's the rapid portion and the slow portion, yep.

559
01:07:38,782 --> 01:07:39,262
This one right here?

560
01:07:39,863 --> 01:07:43,866
Okay.

561
01:07:45,407 --> 01:07:49,089
Yeah, but if I, so that's a good question.

562
01:07:49,269 --> 01:08:01,178
If I then push this to 90%, you are correct that things start to linger a bit more, but it becomes a little bit more problematic because you might not be able to sustain that exercise for 80 minutes.

563
01:08:02,893 --> 01:08:10,274
So as I increase in exercise intensity by default, if I told you to sprint as fast as you can, well, that's probably going to be like 15 seconds.

564
01:08:10,935 --> 01:08:13,695
And so you're not going to see this as large of an increase.

565
01:08:14,155 --> 01:08:16,496
And that's why that fat oxidation starts to curl down.

566
01:08:17,276 --> 01:08:25,537
So if you stay on that max fat oxidation intensity and you maintain that, you'll get kind of the dual benefit during exercise and post exercise.

567
01:08:25,557 --> 01:08:26,898
So that would be a combination of the two.

568
01:08:27,098 --> 01:08:28,558
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah.

569
01:08:32,937 --> 01:08:35,359
Okay, so these are the two parts, right?

570
01:08:35,419 --> 01:08:39,542
If we're looking at moderate exercise, so kind of the lower intensity exercise.

571
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:53,253
We talked about this already, where if you jump on a treadmill and start exercising, you don't automatically have a heart rate, ventilation, and oxygen consumption that matches the energy demand.

572
01:08:54,074 --> 01:08:57,517
It takes a little bit of time for us to reach steady state.

573
01:08:59,659 --> 01:09:02,241
Anything that's shaded on the left of this

574
01:09:03,575 --> 01:09:06,776
Well, we had to use what kind of sources to keep us on the treadmill?

575
01:09:11,178 --> 01:09:14,539
Yeah, anaerobic or non-oxidative or those immediate energy sources.

576
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,341
We had to rely on those to keep us running.

577
01:09:19,001 --> 01:09:21,242
And that's why that's deemed like O2 debt.

578
01:09:21,802 --> 01:09:22,843
We didn't use oxygen.

579
01:09:23,303 --> 01:09:25,744
The demand was much higher than what we actually utilized.

580
01:09:26,824 --> 01:09:28,825
Okay, and then we stop exercise at six minutes.

581
01:09:29,995 --> 01:09:32,116
And you all have probably experienced this before.

582
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:37,618
Maybe you're running after the bus or you're running late to class or you're just kind of exercising and then you sit down.

583
01:09:38,298 --> 01:09:41,940
Well, you don't sit down and automatically your heart rate drops and your ventilation drops.

584
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:44,821
No, it takes a little bit for you to settle down.

585
01:09:46,521 --> 01:09:48,162
That's what this piece is here.

586
01:09:48,222 --> 01:09:55,685
If I shade this in, you are not doing any work, but you are still consuming oxygen here.

587
01:09:56,772 --> 01:10:00,573
This initial slope here is the rapid component.

588
01:10:01,693 --> 01:10:06,275
And then once the slope starts to flatten out, that's the slow component.

589
01:10:09,996 --> 01:10:21,399
If then I bump you up to a harder exercise intensity, you will see a larger O2 debt and a larger epoch.

590
01:10:25,445 --> 01:10:30,389
Here we are almost saying they have reached VO2 max.

591
01:10:32,911 --> 01:10:44,200
In order for this individual to sustain the exercise from oxidative phosphorylation, they would need to consume 4.5 liters per minute.

592
01:10:45,601 --> 01:10:49,485
For whatever reason, they are unable to do that.

593
01:10:50,626 --> 01:10:52,707
And so the maximum oxygen consumption is 3.5.

594
01:10:54,933 --> 01:10:59,515
That means they are an O2 deficit all the way up to this 4.5 spot.

595
01:11:02,896 --> 01:11:09,038
Once you stop exercise, you can see the dramatic change in epoch.

596
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:16,041
So this one kind of flattened out almost to baseline after, what is that, four minutes after exercise?

597
01:11:16,961 --> 01:11:17,822
Whereas this one,

598
01:11:19,102 --> 01:11:27,247
we're kind of delaying this all the way out to almost 14 minutes and it didn't even flatten off and this actually extends for quite a long time.

599
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:41,215
And so you can see the rapid component and the slow component are much longer compared to moderate exercise.

600
01:11:46,023 --> 01:11:54,971
Though it's not the only contributing factor, a larger O2 debt will result in a larger epoch.

601
01:11:57,033 --> 01:12:09,765
So if I draw a larger area under the curve over here or under this line, then that will be, so larger O2 debt, larger epoch.

602
01:12:10,105 --> 01:12:11,487
So if I'm just shading this in,

603
01:12:13,132 --> 01:12:19,796
If you actually take this area, you take the integral of this and the integral of that, they actually don't equal one to one.

604
01:12:19,816 --> 01:12:20,176
So it's not 100%.

605
01:12:22,118 --> 01:12:25,600
But if I see a large O2 debt, I know there's going to be a large epoch.

606
01:12:30,002 --> 01:12:31,623
So then what are all the factors?

607
01:12:31,984 --> 01:12:34,185
Well, here are the factors contributing to epoch.

608
01:12:36,338 --> 01:12:50,648
This one over here, restoration of muscle and blood oxygen stores and the resynthesis of phosphocreatine are gonna contribute to the rapid portion of EPOC, whereas the conversion of lactate to glucose as well as all of these others are gonna contribute to the slow component.

609
01:12:59,194 --> 01:12:59,995
Any questions here?

610
01:13:04,317 --> 01:13:04,618
All right.

611
01:13:04,638 --> 01:13:06,763
Well, that's all I have for you.

612
01:13:06,863 --> 01:13:07,825
Enjoy your weekend.

613
01:13:08,707 --> 01:13:09,209
Have a good one.
