1
00:02:27,603 --> 00:02:29,646
All right, welcome back.

2
00:02:30,827 --> 00:02:31,908
Let's get started here.

3
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,022
All right.

4
00:02:43,022 --> 00:02:49,270
So today we're gonna start the new chapter, chapter five.

5
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,155
We're gonna be looking at some hormonal responses to exercise.

6
00:02:54,316 --> 00:02:59,471
We should be able to get a decent amount through this today.

7
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,116
We'll finish it up on Thursday.

8
00:03:01,116 --> 00:03:06,973
And then Thursday, as well as Tuesday, we will get into immunology.

9
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:09,520
Your exam will be on Thursday.

10
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,083
next Thursday.

11
00:03:11,904 --> 00:03:16,573
I'll go over a few more details about the exam on Thursday.

12
00:03:16,573 --> 00:03:22,243
But essentially, you're looking at multiple choice questions around 30 or so.

13
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,489
But I'll give you some more details on that on Thursday.

14
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:27,192
OK.

15
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:32,579
So let's go ahead and get started with chapter five.

16
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,525
We're going to be talking about a little bit about endocrinology.

17
00:03:37,446 --> 00:03:43,754
I know we have a fantastic faculty group here that teaches endocrinology.

18
00:03:43,754 --> 00:03:46,358
So we're not going into details.

19
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:50,085
With this unit, all we are trying to do is get a

20
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:57,639
broad overview and then see how we can relate the hormonal response to exercise.

21
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,342
In particular, we're going to be looking at

22
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:06,355
substrate mobilization or substrate utilization and how different hormones impact substrate utilization.

23
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:08,941
And then we'll quickly talk about changes in plasma

24
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:17,722
volume during exercise and how vasopressin and aldosterone are influencing changes in plasma volume.

25
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:22,032
Okay, so let's get started.

26
00:04:22,032 --> 00:04:23,014
Endocrinology.

27
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:28,635
If we were to just make a broad kind of summary

28
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:33,741
of it, we're just saying endocrinology is a communication system.

29
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:38,486
There are two major ways our body communicates with other cells.

30
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,490
One would be a nervous system, and so that's sending

31
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,453
electrical signals from one cell to the other.

32
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:48,998
And then we have the endocrine system, which is a chemical communication.

33
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:53,104
Sometimes I like making the analogy of communication when

34
00:04:53,104 --> 00:05:00,075
comparing nervous and endocrine as like how you would communicate anyone who's maybe further away.

35
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:02,739
So if you had a friend in a different state and you

36
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:07,206
wanted to get a hold of that friend, you probably would pick up the telephone and call them.

37
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:13,015
So that's usually an electrical signal sent through, well, old school telephone lines.

38
00:05:14,024 --> 00:05:17,649
Endocrine would be like you writing a letter and putting it

39
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:20,352
into the mail and having that get sent out.

40
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:23,596
So it's a little bit slower, still gets the message

41
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:30,705
across, but there could be better use cases for one versus the

42
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:36,673
other, but it's just one thing to kind of think about when we're looking at endocrine versus nervous.

43
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:41,879
Okay, well, if I'm sending a letter out or if

44
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:47,765
I'm sending a chemical communication, something has to receive that letter.

45
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:49,007
You have to have a mailbox.

46
00:05:49,007 --> 00:05:54,353
If there's no mailbox, that person is not gonna get that letter.

47
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:59,999
So we have this hormone receptor interaction where there has

48
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:03,083
to be some sort of receptor on the target cell.

49
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:10,136
So if the hormone can't attach to the cell, then the cell doesn't really get that message.

50
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:20,374
And so we need to have a receptor to have the hormonal effect or that physiological response.

51
00:06:20,374 --> 00:06:25,864
We can coordinate these systems during rest and exercise.

52
00:06:26,823 --> 00:06:33,049
This really helps us maintain homeostasis or steady state during exercise

53
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:35,852
because we can control substrate metabolism, which is this

54
00:06:35,852 --> 00:06:39,256
big piece here, and then regulate fluid and electrolyte balance.

55
00:06:43,981 --> 00:06:47,965
So the big take-home picture is it doesn't matter if I

56
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:53,050
flood the body with hormones if the cell does not have that receptor

57
00:06:54,312 --> 00:06:57,115
take on that chemical message, there's no response.

58
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:05,663
Chemical class of hormones are here, peptides, amino acids, and steroids.

59
00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:10,187
You do not really need to know the distinction between these three.

60
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:12,689
As far as chemical distinction, you just need to

61
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:16,513
know that there are peptides and polypeptides that act as

62
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:21,008
hormones, amino acid derivatives, as well as steroids.

63
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:25,272
it will be helpful to know that steroids do not need a

64
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:29,797
receptor outside of the cell or in the cell membrane.

65
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:33,861
They can freely cross the cell membrane, but then they

66
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:36,483
eventually need a receptor inside of the cell.

67
00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:41,248
So the receptor's inside of the cell here.

68
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:47,134
Amino acids and peptides, they need to attach to a receptor on the surface of the cell membrane.

69
00:07:49,072 --> 00:07:51,935
So that's the, if you were to just take home a

70
00:07:51,935 --> 00:07:58,661
picture from here or the message, it's just maybe where the receptors are in the different classes.

71
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,786
Okay, so if you get a hormone to bind to a

72
00:08:03,786 --> 00:08:09,832
certain receptor, it's in the mailbox, well, something has to kind of respond to it.

73
00:08:11,013 --> 00:08:14,957
Well, these receptors typically activate something called secondary

74
00:08:14,957 --> 00:08:18,100
messengers, and they do that via a G protein.

75
00:08:19,683 --> 00:08:25,963
once they activate these secondary messengers, now that causes the cell to respond.

76
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:30,569
and they can then modify existing proteins.

77
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:33,433
So there are a lot of different secondary messengers.

78
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:38,640
You would not necessarily need to memorize this or reproduce this on an exam,

79
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,430
but if you saw that there is DAG, you should know that that's a secondary messenger,

80
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,675
or if I told you the secondary messenger DAG, you

81
00:08:48,675 --> 00:08:53,301
should realize how that might impact certain cellular responses later on.

82
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:02,772
So if you activate genes to synthesize new proteins, those proteins can then go do something.

83
00:09:04,154 --> 00:09:06,759
For example, if I am activating some type of

84
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:12,187
transporter protein, then those proteins would then translocate to

85
00:09:12,187 --> 00:09:16,374
the surface of the membrane and allow for the movement of certain molecules.

86
00:09:16,374 --> 00:09:20,200
And we'll get into an example of that a little bit later on.

87
00:09:22,964 --> 00:09:24,085
OK, so far, big picture.

88
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:25,747
We get a hormone released into the blood.

89
00:09:25,747 --> 00:09:27,349
It binds to a receptor.

90
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:31,293
The receptor causes some sort of response inside of the cell.

91
00:09:31,293 --> 00:09:36,378
One example would be altering transport inside of the cell

92
00:09:36,378 --> 00:09:41,203
or on the outside of the cell, the membrane, to allow for movement of molecules.

93
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,473
OK, so far, again, that was the

94
00:09:51,736 --> 00:09:57,464
the quick summary or the extent of endocrinology background that

95
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,767
you'll need for the rest of these slides.

96
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,475
Okay, so substrate mobilization during exercise.

97
00:10:07,798 --> 00:10:11,283
There are some major endocrine glands that we're gonna be focusing on

98
00:10:11,283 --> 00:10:16,210
for metabolic regulation, anterior pituitary gland, the

99
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,735
thyroid gland, adrenal gland, and pancreas.

100
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,243
We're gonna focus on which or what kind of hormones

101
00:10:25,243 --> 00:10:32,392
are being released by these glands and how they impact carbohydrate and fat utilization during exercise.

102
00:10:32,392 --> 00:10:35,896
So how they impact different substrates during exercise.

103
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:45,707
Okay, let's start with hormone number one, growth hormone.

104
00:10:45,707 --> 00:10:49,131
Growth hormone is synthesized in the anterior pituitary.

105
00:10:50,765 --> 00:10:55,393
Basically, again, don't worry too much about the details in here.

106
00:10:55,393 --> 00:10:59,700
This is more for your information, but anterior pituitary

107
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:06,432
gland secretes growth hormone that then acts on different tissues.

108
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:10,258
That could be the entire body or maybe the adrenal cortex.

109
00:11:10,258 --> 00:11:16,789
They're just happening to act, or you can think of it as different cells in the body

110
00:11:18,322 --> 00:11:25,144
have receptors for growth hormone.

111
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:27,712
Why would we want to secrete growth hormone?

112
00:11:28,836 --> 00:11:32,058
Well, this would be a good kind of

113
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:36,069
area to see why we would or what causes that secretion.

114
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:41,624
So here, the control of growth hormone release, exercise sleep, stress,

115
00:11:41,624 --> 00:11:45,053
and low plasma glucose are going to result in the

116
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:48,362
secretion of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary.

117
00:11:52,072 --> 00:11:58,020
Once you get the growth hormone produced, it's going to cause some actions here.

118
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:03,288
The actions that we're going to kind of focus on would be the stimulation of protein synthesis

119
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:07,093
and growth, as well as a little bit of gluconeogenesis

120
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:14,384
in the liver and blocks glucose entry in the adipose cell to favor fat mobilization.

121
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:20,962
There are some negative feedback loops,

122
00:12:20,962 --> 00:12:26,813
Essentially, we're looking at exercise, because exercise physiology,

123
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:30,980
how that is being secreted to impact some of these things down here.

124
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,353
So the level of detail that I'm kind of explaining to

125
00:12:38,353 --> 00:12:43,202
you on these slides is the level of detail that you need to focus on for maybe the exam.

126
00:12:43,202 --> 00:12:45,366
So not a whole lot.

127
00:12:47,624 --> 00:12:53,430
Okay, here's when we get into a few things as far as growth hormone.

128
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,833
It's a potent anabolic hormone, builds tissues and

129
00:12:56,833 --> 00:13:00,437
organs, and promotes hypertrophy or muscle growth.

130
00:13:01,678 --> 00:13:06,223
We'll get into kind of this hyperplasia, hypertrophy, but

131
00:13:07,184 --> 00:13:09,726
for now we're just saying promotes muscle growth.

132
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:15,252
This is for your information.

133
00:13:16,092 --> 00:13:20,398
If you completely ignored this figure down here, you'd

134
00:13:20,398 --> 00:13:24,124
be okay, but it's just for your information, if you wanted to

135
00:13:24,124 --> 00:13:27,028
see a little bit more detail on how that's happening.

136
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:29,632
But no surprise, there's a receptor for growth hormone

137
00:13:29,632 --> 00:13:35,080
here that's causing some type of secondary reaction over here, and that's gonna lead to hypertrophy.

138
00:13:37,304 --> 00:13:40,868
The one piece, you don't need to know this for this exam,

139
00:13:40,868 --> 00:13:46,255
but keep in the back of your mind later on, this mTOR, this mTOR pathway.

140
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:51,742
So this will come up when we get into muscle physiology,

141
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:55,207
but that might be something to keep in the back of your mind.

142
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:04,358
Okay, so during exercise then, what do we normally see with the growth hormone concentration?

143
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:10,733
If we have some individuals undergoing prolonged and graded exercise,

144
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:17,804
as time increases, we see growth hormone also increase

145
00:14:17,804 --> 00:14:21,249
in the release or concentration in the blood.

146
00:14:22,771 --> 00:14:28,620
If I increase intensity, we also see growth hormone increase.

147
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:33,106
Pretty easy with this one, right?

148
00:14:33,968 --> 00:14:35,610
Prolonged exercise,

149
00:14:36,552 --> 00:14:37,673
growth hormone increases.

150
00:14:38,915 --> 00:14:43,981
Graded exercise for increasing intensity, growth hormone increases.

151
00:14:43,981 --> 00:14:47,204
In this course, we're not really focusing too much on

152
00:14:47,204 --> 00:14:50,028
the magnitude of increase or comparing the two.

153
00:14:50,028 --> 00:14:54,053
You just need to know that if I increase intensity, growth hormone goes up.

154
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:57,637
If I increase duration at the same intensity, growth hormone goes up.

155
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:05,486
Okay, so then why is this important?

156
00:15:05,486 --> 00:15:06,407
True or false here?

157
00:15:17,795 --> 00:15:18,977
Give me a second on this.

158
00:15:39,747 --> 00:15:42,351
Okay, should be open now.

159
00:15:47,022 --> 00:15:49,653
True or false, human growth hormone is effective

160
00:15:49,653 --> 00:15:52,786
at increasing resistance training induced hypertrophy and strength

161
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:56,340
in young adults with normal growth hormone levels.

162
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,814
Okay, does anyone need a little more time getting set up here?

163
00:16:51,558 --> 00:16:55,824
Okay, I'll close this down in, I don't know, five seconds or so.

164
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:02,514
Okay, three, two, one.

165
00:17:05,398 --> 00:17:07,721
Okay, yeah, most of us are saying true.

166
00:17:07,721 --> 00:17:12,868
With these true and falses, you can almost think of that the questions are almost

167
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:18,083
a little too broad where you could argue a little bit for and against.

168
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:23,516
But in this instance, there are some good studies that kind of looked into this.

169
00:17:23,516 --> 00:17:24,740
They have some limitations.

170
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,723
But in general, increases in circulating anabolic hormones is not required.

171
00:17:29,723 --> 00:17:37,010
for resistance-induced hypertrophy, meaning you don't necessarily need it to have muscle growth,

172
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:41,555
but it looks like high circulating levels

173
00:17:41,555 --> 00:17:47,761
of these hormones can support resistance-training-induced hypertrophy.

174
00:17:47,761 --> 00:17:52,686
So although it's not required, it definitely can maybe help,

175
00:17:52,686 --> 00:17:56,170
so we need to be careful about pushing the two where

176
00:17:57,044 --> 00:18:02,122
It might be good to get someone to get a

177
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:06,517
muscle mass increase after they plateau, but you definitely

178
00:18:06,517 --> 00:18:09,788
don't need growth hormone necessarily to have hypertrophy.

179
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:19,785
So normal adults show an increase in lead body mass, but this is a lot of the studies

180
00:18:19,785 --> 00:18:23,070
that kind of looked into this growth hormone supplementation

181
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:29,558
saw a lot of water retention as opposed to the increase in cell mass in itself.

182
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:32,983
So they weren't necessarily increasing the sarcomeres in

183
00:18:32,983 --> 00:18:37,329
parallel, but they were just increasing the existing sarcomere that

184
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:41,074
was there, maybe by putting on a little bit more water mass.

185
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:47,635
To this point, there's no direct evidence that growth hormone promotes strength gains.

186
00:18:49,018 --> 00:18:52,684
So there are minimal strength gains compared to resistance training alone.

187
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:56,150
Now, the one thing we have to keep in mind, or I

188
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,215
guess two things, if we go back to this prompt here,

189
00:19:00,713 --> 00:19:05,742
or the question, they already have normal growth hormone levels.

190
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:06,944
So we have to keep that in mind.

191
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:09,889
If someone's maybe a little bit lower than normal, well,

192
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:14,136
yeah, of course, if we give them some growth hormone, that might actually help.

193
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:21,301
Number two, we'll touch on this a little bit, but most of the studies

194
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:25,912
are only using growth hormone, where I'm not saying this always happens,

195
00:19:25,912 --> 00:19:28,298
but people are usually stacking with other type of

196
00:19:28,298 --> 00:19:31,686
steroids, or they're using other things, or they're using different doses.

197
00:19:32,648 --> 00:19:34,332
But at higher doses,

198
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:39,391
This typically results in more adverse effects than benefits.

199
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:43,297
So you can get some water retention and edema.

200
00:19:43,297 --> 00:19:49,146
You can get joint and muscle aches and then increase risk of infected injection-related diseases.

201
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:55,155
So you can get some infections from some of the use of, say, needles.

202
00:19:57,346 --> 00:20:01,532
So again, you kind of have to take this in the context of some of these studies.

203
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:05,097
They don't necessarily use maybe the strategies that everyone

204
00:20:05,097 --> 00:20:11,527
is using to date, mainly because we have internal review boards that oversee ethics.

205
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:15,993
And so you wouldn't necessarily be able to give them the doses that maybe people are using.

206
00:20:15,993 --> 00:20:17,456
outside of research.

207
00:20:17,456 --> 00:20:22,184
And then two, most people don't just use growth hormone alone.

208
00:20:22,184 --> 00:20:25,490
You kind of have to pair it with some other things like testosterone and other things like that.

209
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,475
Not that I'm encouraging this at all, but I'm just saying

210
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:31,580
we have to be careful about how we interpret some of these studies.

211
00:20:33,864 --> 00:20:38,200
OK, the physiology of growth hormone and sport.

212
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,983
So if we're looking over here, we see some

213
00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:46,214
baseline levels in short-term growth hormone excretion, we can say, and long-term.

214
00:20:47,236 --> 00:20:50,762
So protein remodeling, we're seeing some changes here,

215
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:55,029
but net protein synthesis over the long-term or the long periods

216
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:58,114
of time, we're not seeing a really big difference.

217
00:20:58,114 --> 00:21:03,395
Maybe short-term there is a benefit and then we start to plateau off because

218
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,039
It kind of makes sense that there are some

219
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:12,330
adverse effects with long-term steroid or growth hormones.

220
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,295
Body protein mass looks like once you get to a

221
00:21:15,295 --> 00:21:21,105
certain point, your body can't really produce more than what it already has.

222
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:24,711
And it appears to be some type of plateau or leveling off.

223
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,280
And then strength gains are a little bit controversial

224
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,992
because if we're just getting more water retention and it

225
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:39,322
appears that an individual is getting bigger, that doesn't necessarily mean that they're getting stronger.

226
00:21:39,322 --> 00:21:42,928
Again, if I have some long-term use and I have

227
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:46,795
some adverse effects, that can even impair strength.

228
00:21:46,795 --> 00:21:49,560
So that's why there's a lot of kind of back and

229
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:54,368
forth on some of the growth, I guess, growth hormone use.

230
00:21:54,368 --> 00:21:58,275
And then do keep in mind that the study, all these results are a little bit older.

231
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:02,562
I know there's some newer results, but they all kind of are saying the same thing.

232
00:22:06,676 --> 00:22:15,864
We briefly touched on a little bit about this idea of maybe evidence is limited.

233
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:19,668
But yeah, although there is limited available evidence

234
00:22:19,668 --> 00:22:24,372
to suggest that growth hormone increases lean body mass, it may not improve strength.

235
00:22:24,372 --> 00:22:28,536
In addition, it may worsen exercise capacity and increase adverse events.

236
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:37,473
So essentially, it's kind of left in this little gray area.

237
00:22:37,473 --> 00:22:43,125
Because if you just saw this, then you would think, oh,

238
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,230
well, growth hormone's not that big of a deal.

239
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:49,238
It's not really helping or improving performance.

240
00:22:50,298 --> 00:22:54,362
But I know everybody here has access to the internet.

241
00:22:54,362 --> 00:22:58,045
There are very, very successful Olympic athletes who

242
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:02,129
have been caught using these performance enhancing drugs.

243
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:06,513
And they have been shown to do quite well in certain instances.

244
00:23:06,513 --> 00:23:12,859
So I guess my take home is just in certain situations, maybe they're not good.

245
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:16,482
In certain situations, maybe people are taking advantage of it.

246
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:19,225
So I just kind of wanted to give both sides to the story here.

247
00:23:21,027 --> 00:23:24,176
And we'll get into ergogenic aids a little bit later.

248
00:23:24,176 --> 00:23:27,244
But again, there are different strategies that people sometimes

249
00:23:27,244 --> 00:23:29,410
take on to get better, more benefits.

250
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:33,923
Any questions on the growth hormone?

251
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:38,832
Okay, let's move on to catecholamines.

252
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,416
A lot of the times, so in endocrinology, we

253
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:45,700
do make a big distinction between norepinephrine epinephrine,

254
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,465
but especially inside of exercise physiology, we're basically

255
00:23:49,465 --> 00:23:52,789
just gonna say catecholamines or adrenaline, this is

256
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:57,034
being secreted, norepinephrine epinephrine is what we're looking at here.

257
00:23:59,657 --> 00:24:03,012
So here you have sympathetic,

258
00:24:03,012 --> 00:24:07,036
on a stimulus causing the release of this norepinephrine epinephrine,

259
00:24:07,036 --> 00:24:10,359
and then you have some alpha and beta adrenergic receptors

260
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:16,384
on the tissue or the cells, and they're gonna respond to the catecholamine.

261
00:24:18,806 --> 00:24:21,088
Most of you have probably heard of this before, but

262
00:24:21,088 --> 00:24:26,233
in general, what does catecholamines do, or what response should

263
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:31,197
we expect, or what term saying have you heard with catecholamines?

264
00:24:32,493 --> 00:24:36,198
I think people are, I heard some people say it, yeah.

265
00:24:36,198 --> 00:24:37,680
Yeah, fight or flight, right?

266
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,725
So you have the fight or flight response here.

267
00:24:40,725 --> 00:24:44,550
You can get some hypothalamus activation of the

268
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:49,016
sympathetic division of nervous system that results in an increase in heart rate blood pressure.

269
00:24:49,977 --> 00:24:51,620
And then you get an increased blood flow of the

270
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:56,847
skeletal muscles and then you reduce the activity of the inactive muscles.

271
00:24:58,717 --> 00:25:02,002
So in this situation, you got a bear chasing somebody.

272
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:05,086
Does anyone notice something pretty interesting about this photo here?

273
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,069
What's a little odd about what's going on?

274
00:25:09,192 --> 00:25:10,715
Yeah, the guy's smiling, right?

275
00:25:10,715 --> 00:25:12,597
Like, I don't know about you, but if I'm running from

276
00:25:12,597 --> 00:25:15,001
a bear, I don't know if I'm smiling, but yeah.

277
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:18,606
So essentially, you can either fight or flight.

278
00:25:20,068 --> 00:25:24,775
The other thing is, anyone know the saying with different bears?

279
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,632
Yeah, yeah.

280
00:25:28,632 --> 00:25:30,716
So you typically don't want to run.

281
00:25:30,716 --> 00:25:34,462
Well, the suggestion is that you don't run from a black bear.

282
00:25:34,462 --> 00:25:36,506
You try to fight a black bear.

283
00:25:36,506 --> 00:25:39,711
And then, yeah, you lie down with brown bears.

284
00:25:39,711 --> 00:25:43,859
Or you definitely don't run from a bear in general.

285
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:47,886
But if I was in that situation, I don't think I'm thinking about these things.

286
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:49,589
I'm just maybe panicking and running.

287
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:52,008
But yeah.

288
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,832
The point though still gets across, right?

289
00:25:53,832 --> 00:25:56,617
There's some type of stimulus causing a fight or

290
00:25:56,617 --> 00:26:01,167
flight response that is the secretion of catecholamines that are

291
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:03,191
gonna result in some of these responses here.

292
00:26:05,155 --> 00:26:10,185
So in a table form, we have these physiological responses.

293
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,405
I would not suggest memorizing these, but if you were

294
00:26:15,405 --> 00:26:22,014
starting to review this, all of these should make sense after we get through the rest of the slides here.

295
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:24,898
So you can come back here and say, oh, okay,

296
00:26:24,898 --> 00:26:29,464
it's gonna increase fatty acid mobilization from the adipose tissue

297
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:32,308
if I have an increase in catecholamine secretion.

298
00:26:37,908 --> 00:26:40,652
Okay, so same deal like growth hormone.

299
00:26:40,652 --> 00:26:47,984
Let's look at catecholamines and see how they increase during prolonged and graded exercise.

300
00:26:47,984 --> 00:26:54,674
No surprise, both prolonged and graded exercise, we see an increase in catecholamines secretion.

301
00:26:54,674 --> 00:26:59,021
So both norepinephrine and epinephrine increase as duration

302
00:26:59,021 --> 00:27:03,207
gets longer and as intensity gets higher.

303
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,563
And we see that across all intensities of exercise here.

304
00:27:18,632 --> 00:27:20,995
This slide gets a little more interesting.

305
00:27:20,995 --> 00:27:28,324
The one kind of asterisk that you need to put on this slide is this is at the same workload.

306
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:36,113
So we wanna see how plasma epinephrine concentrations change after training.

307
00:27:37,308 --> 00:27:44,394
If I am at the same workload pre-post training, I

308
00:27:44,394 --> 00:27:49,058
should expect to see a lower concentration of epinephrine in my blood.

309
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,264
Rationally thinking about this, I think it makes sense.

310
00:27:55,264 --> 00:28:01,850
As I train, the same exercise intensity gets easier.

311
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:05,813
Well, if it gets easier, then we're going kind of backwards.

312
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,803
on this one here, on this graded exercise intensity.

313
00:28:10,724 --> 00:28:13,247
So instead of going up, we're kind of going down.

314
00:28:13,247 --> 00:28:18,593
So yeah, I would expect to see after several weeks

315
00:28:18,593 --> 00:28:23,418
of training, say seven weeks of training, the same exercise

316
00:28:23,418 --> 00:28:28,323
intensity should result in a lower epinephrine, norepinephrine secretion.

317
00:28:35,691 --> 00:28:36,492
Are we okay here?

318
00:28:39,644 --> 00:28:42,187
Yeah.

319
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:43,248
So both epinephrine and norepinephrine are lower?

320
00:28:43,248 --> 00:28:44,789
Yeah, yeah.

321
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:48,673
And so a lot of times if I say epinephrine, we're also talking about norepinephrine.

322
00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:51,496
It's catecholamines on a whole.

323
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,697
For exercise physiology.

324
00:28:59,764 --> 00:29:02,487
Okay.

325
00:29:02,487 --> 00:29:03,528
Next one, cortisol.

326
00:29:04,469 --> 00:29:09,361
What do we usually kind of associate cortisol with?

327
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:11,924
Stress, yeah, stress response.

328
00:29:11,924 --> 00:29:15,369
So the synthesis of cortisol occurs in the adrenal cortex.

329
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:20,175
If these are our kidneys, we have an adrenal gland

330
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:29,346
right above them, and these adrenal glands are secreting cortisol.

331
00:29:29,346 --> 00:29:33,211
Just like you had mentioned, stress causes the release

332
00:29:33,211 --> 00:29:36,415
of cortisol, which then acts on different tissues.

333
00:29:40,192 --> 00:29:46,158
Note that I skipped everything in between here because you don't need to know this piece, right?

334
00:29:46,158 --> 00:29:48,220
We have endocrinology for you to learn all this.

335
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,624
So exercise, I like how they've put bone break, right?

336
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,286
Like it's so severe.

337
00:29:54,286 --> 00:29:55,407
Break your bone, of course.

338
00:29:55,407 --> 00:30:00,132
Injury, burns, and stress are gonna cause the release of cortisol.

339
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:05,237
Of course, we're gonna focus more on the exercise piece.

340
00:30:06,061 --> 00:30:10,326
So changes in plasma cortisol during acute graded exercise.

341
00:30:10,326 --> 00:30:15,733
As we increase exercise intensity, we see plasma cortisol increase.

342
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:19,738
I know there's a little bit going on here where we

343
00:30:19,738 --> 00:30:22,521
see a decrease over here and this percent change.

344
00:30:24,884 --> 00:30:31,232
But the overall picture here is as we increase intensity, cortisol increases.

345
00:30:32,654 --> 00:30:34,296
That's the take-home picture for here.

346
00:30:35,508 --> 00:30:37,332
So far we're doing pretty good though, right?

347
00:30:38,414 --> 00:30:46,089
It looks like growth hormone, catecholamines, as well as cortisol, all increased during exercise.

348
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:51,639
Should be pretty straightforward.

349
00:30:51,639 --> 00:30:52,541
Not too bad here, right?

350
00:30:53,824 --> 00:30:56,048
All right, let's move on to glucagon then.

351
00:30:58,238 --> 00:31:01,021
This one is a little interesting.

352
00:31:01,021 --> 00:31:06,026
Does anyone remember from endocrinology or physiology what glucagon

353
00:31:07,268 --> 00:31:10,391
is or does or gets what situation?

354
00:31:15,777 --> 00:31:17,399
Promotes glucose uptake?

355
00:31:20,122 --> 00:31:23,065
Yeah, so then what about, well,

356
00:31:24,513 --> 00:31:25,635
Yeah, that's okay.

357
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:27,417
Let's just get into it then here.

358
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:32,584
So really quick, the synthesis of glucagon occurs in the pancreas.

359
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:37,250
And so we're looking over here at the alpha cells.

360
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:42,697
So the alpha cells in the pancreas produce glucagon.

361
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,285
The beta cells produce something called insulin and we'll get to that in a second.

362
00:31:49,647 --> 00:31:52,090
So the alpha cells produce glucagon.

363
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:55,052
and those alpha cells are located in the pancreas.

364
00:31:57,754 --> 00:32:04,841
Okay, so if we have a low blood sugar, that is

365
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:09,465
kind of a disturbance or an imbalance in homeostasis, so the

366
00:32:09,465 --> 00:32:17,192
body wants to raise the blood sugar, and so we're going to produce some of this glucagon.

367
00:32:17,192 --> 00:32:23,356
So a decrease in plasma glucose is gonna cause an increase in the glucagon secretion,

368
00:32:23,356 --> 00:32:27,503
that ultimately is going to cause an increase in plasma glucose.

369
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:35,336
If the increase gets too high, there's a negative feedback that then kind of stops this.

370
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:46,714
Glucogon acts on the liver as well as the adipose tissue.

371
00:32:48,803 --> 00:32:51,586
and then it results in these responses here.

372
00:32:51,586 --> 00:32:55,530
So one, liver is going to produce glucose.

373
00:32:57,032 --> 00:33:02,057
It's also going to increase lipolysis and increase free fatty acids.

374
00:33:02,057 --> 00:33:06,162
That way we can try to spare glucose utilization.

375
00:33:10,427 --> 00:33:12,088
So it's kind of two-fold.

376
00:33:12,088 --> 00:33:15,192
Produce more glucose and then maybe make some other

377
00:33:15,192 --> 00:33:18,135
substrates readily available so we can spare glucose.

378
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:24,142
Glucose actions.

379
00:33:24,142 --> 00:33:26,665
Well, or glucagon action, sorry.

380
00:33:26,665 --> 00:33:28,949
Just increasing blood glucose levels.

381
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,973
Highlighted a few of these areas.

382
00:33:31,973 --> 00:33:35,738
Again, I wouldn't memorize this because in general, this

383
00:33:35,738 --> 00:33:40,545
table does a good job, but essentially you're increasing glucose levels.

384
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:49,675
Okay, so changes in plasma glucagon during prolonged

385
00:33:49,675 --> 00:33:52,900
exercise in trained and untrained individuals.

386
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,623
Let's look at the untrained first.

387
00:33:54,623 --> 00:34:00,531
So prolonged exercise results in an increase, sorry, an

388
00:34:00,531 --> 00:34:06,901
increase in duration causes an increase in glucagon secretion.

389
00:34:06,901 --> 00:34:08,423
This is also a little,

390
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:13,318
A little tricky, but it goes to the same concept

391
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:18,685
as when we talked about training with epinephrine or catecholamine secretion.

392
00:34:20,307 --> 00:34:23,751
If I'm at the same exercise intensity and then I

393
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:27,896
take it throughout the duration, we are not seeing the

394
00:34:27,896 --> 00:34:32,762
same increase in glucagon because again, that exercise is much easier.

395
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:37,988
But on a whole,

396
00:34:39,048 --> 00:34:44,654
If we are increasing duration or intensity, we're seeing that glucagon come up.

397
00:34:47,236 --> 00:34:53,182
The big thing you have to kind of think about as far as intensity and duration would be

398
00:34:53,182 --> 00:34:57,166
if I am starting to deplete glucose levels because I'm

399
00:34:57,166 --> 00:35:02,091
exercising too long, the body will release glucagon, trained or

400
00:35:02,091 --> 00:35:04,794
not trained, to get the glucose levels back up.

401
00:35:08,297 --> 00:35:09,038
Are we OK there?

402
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:14,659
So sometimes it gets a little tricky thinking about at the same exercise intensity

403
00:35:14,659 --> 00:35:17,903
after eight weeks of training, well yeah, we don't see

404
00:35:17,903 --> 00:35:21,187
a big change because this intensity is not really causing

405
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:26,675
any large changes in glucose levels because we're able to

406
00:35:26,675 --> 00:35:29,658
sustain it with the glycogen that we already have.

407
00:35:29,658 --> 00:35:30,840
I think I saw a question, yeah.

408
00:35:40,523 --> 00:35:44,009
Yeah, so you're basically trying to spare the glucose

409
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:48,736
molecules by maybe relying on beta oxidation a little bit, yeah.

410
00:35:48,736 --> 00:35:53,183
If you undergo glycolysis, you're gonna break down glucose and then make it even worse.

411
00:35:53,183 --> 00:35:56,809
So you kinda wanna spare the glucose and use something else.

412
00:35:56,809 --> 00:35:57,891
Yeah, good question.

413
00:36:04,601 --> 00:36:08,067
Okay, so the flip side to this would be insulin.

414
00:36:10,004 --> 00:36:14,835
Synthesis of insulin in the pancreas again happens in the beta cells.

415
00:36:16,438 --> 00:36:19,766
And the beta cells are releasing insulin.

416
00:36:20,587 --> 00:36:28,104
Insulin then binds to its target receptor and causes plasma glucose to go down.

417
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:29,447
So it's the opposite effect.

418
00:36:30,558 --> 00:36:33,582
So let's say we have low blood glucose.

419
00:36:34,503 --> 00:36:35,844
Glucagon gets secreted.

420
00:36:35,844 --> 00:36:40,770
We then kind of overshoot a little bit so plasma glucose gets too high.

421
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:45,757
Then the body maybe responds to that by releasing some insulin to bring those levels back down.

422
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,983
So we have an increase in plasma glucose.

423
00:36:50,983 --> 00:36:54,385
That means you get an increase in insulin secretion.

424
00:36:54,385 --> 00:37:00,230
You get an increase in kind of glucose uptake in all of the cells.

425
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:06,696
You also get a change or decrease in the gluconeogenesis as far as in the liver.

426
00:37:08,277 --> 00:37:12,221
You don't want to be producing more glucose if you have a surplus.

427
00:37:12,221 --> 00:37:13,782
You kind of want to decrease this over here.

428
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:17,986
Same with breaking down glycogen.

429
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,948
You want to build it up, you don't want to break it down here.

430
00:37:20,868 --> 00:37:23,751
All of those are going to cause a decrease in plasma glucose here.

431
00:37:26,279 --> 00:37:30,004
This is kind of important because if I get a spike

432
00:37:30,004 --> 00:37:36,814
in blood glucose during exercise, you are going to maybe do

433
00:37:36,814 --> 00:37:41,300
the opposite effect of what you might want during exercise.

434
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:49,651
So kind of keep that in the back of your mind when we talk about some other things.

435
00:37:49,651 --> 00:37:50,953
Same deal with these tables.

436
00:37:52,553 --> 00:37:54,555
Make sure you understand what's going on here.

437
00:37:54,555 --> 00:37:56,278
Don't worry too much about memorizing them.

438
00:38:00,883 --> 00:38:04,628
I would, however, spend some time on this slide here.

439
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:09,914
OK, so we're going to bring on a few other hormones and the interactions.

440
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:11,757
So we have epinephrine and norepinephrine.

441
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:20,748
So we have catecholamine stimulation or secretion, as well as glucagon and insulin responses.

442
00:38:20,748 --> 00:38:23,182
So it's going to inhibit insulin.

443
00:38:23,182 --> 00:38:25,886
Okay, so let's start over here on the left.

444
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,430
We have epinephrine or epinephrine.

445
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:34,119
If we get those to be stimulated or secreted, and we look

446
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:39,908
this way at the beta cells, or sorry, at the alpha cells

447
00:38:39,908 --> 00:38:45,477
in the pancreas, that's gonna cause an increase in glucagon.

448
00:38:48,055 --> 00:38:52,520
Glucagon then increases plasma glucagon, or the release

449
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:59,448
causes an increase in plasma glucagon, which then increases the glucose concentration in the blood.

450
00:38:59,448 --> 00:38:59,628
Yeah?

451
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:06,156
The orange beta symbol on the redone cap, is that just like the receptor?

452
00:39:06,156 --> 00:39:08,338
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

453
00:39:08,338 --> 00:39:09,099
This is a receptor.

454
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,482
Beta adrenergic alpha 2.

455
00:39:13,864 --> 00:39:13,984
Good.

456
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,307
Catochole means then,

457
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:27,477
act on the beta cells of the pancreas, which causes a decrease in insulin secretion.

458
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,489
That means plasma insulin goes down, and that's gonna

459
00:39:33,489 --> 00:39:37,958
help the glucose levels or concentrations in the blood to go up.

460
00:39:46,122 --> 00:39:50,590
So make sure we're feeling good here as far as understanding what's going on here.

461
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:53,515
Any questions on the slide?

462
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:56,981
Okay.

463
00:39:59,746 --> 00:40:06,899
Catecholamines, increased plasma glucagon, decreased plasma insulin, net

464
00:40:06,899 --> 00:40:08,822
result is an increase in glucose.

465
00:40:11,266 --> 00:40:15,492
So that means plasma and insulin during acute exercise

466
00:40:15,492 --> 00:40:23,222
in both trained and untrained individuals go down, both in prolonged and graded exercise.

467
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:34,017
So as I increase exercise duration, insulin levels go down.

468
00:40:36,427 --> 00:40:40,996
As I increase exercise intensity, insulin levels go down.

469
00:40:40,996 --> 00:40:43,781
And I know there's like a little bit of a rebound

470
00:40:43,781 --> 00:40:46,106
over here, so it's starting to look like a U-curve.

471
00:40:47,469 --> 00:40:50,755
It actually kind of flattens out because that's not significant.

472
00:40:50,755 --> 00:40:57,388
But for the purposes of this course, you're just saying down with graded exercise.

473
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,272
Okay, so that makes things pretty easy then.

474
00:41:08,914 --> 00:41:13,939
If I have cortisol, glucagon, growth hormone,

475
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:19,425
and catecholamines, with prolonged exercise, everything goes up.

476
00:41:19,425 --> 00:41:21,027
Insulin is the only one that goes down.

477
00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:28,175
With graded exercise, so as intensity increases, everything still

478
00:41:28,175 --> 00:41:31,358
goes up, and insulin is the only one that goes down.

479
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,846
So if there's one slide you just had to memorize, this

480
00:41:39,846 --> 00:41:41,989
one might be a good one to memorize then, right?

481
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:45,093
Because it's, or I guess you just need to memorize one.

482
00:41:45,935 --> 00:41:48,478
Insulin is the only one that goes down, everything else goes up.

483
00:41:55,649 --> 00:41:55,809
Okay.

484
00:41:58,553 --> 00:41:59,375
Questions so far?

485
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:03,100
Nice.

486
00:42:04,227 --> 00:42:07,433
Okay, regulation of carbohydrate metabolism during exercise.

487
00:42:07,433 --> 00:42:13,223
I don't think we need to chat about this, maybe we

488
00:42:13,223 --> 00:42:16,349
do, maybe we don't, but someone wanna help me out.

489
00:42:16,349 --> 00:42:22,320
What happens to carbohydrate utilization during prolonged submaximal exercise?

490
00:42:24,072 --> 00:42:26,436
I guess the why piece maybe you'll have to chat about.

491
00:42:26,436 --> 00:42:28,779
But does anyone want to volunteer?

492
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:34,728
If I have prolonged submaximal exercise, what happens to carbohydrate utilization?

493
00:42:38,153 --> 00:42:38,273
Yeah.

494
00:42:38,273 --> 00:42:44,042
It decreases, right?

495
00:42:44,042 --> 00:42:47,309
So what happens then to?

496
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:50,874
Well, I guess we could before we, well, we'll just go on the second one since I showed it.

497
00:42:50,874 --> 00:42:54,440
So what happens to carbohydrate utilization during graded exercise?

498
00:42:56,723 --> 00:42:58,386
Yeah, it goes up, right?

499
00:42:59,728 --> 00:43:02,192
And then this is where we see the crossover effect.

500
00:43:04,976 --> 00:43:07,179
I'm telling you right now for both lab and lecture

501
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:10,064
exam, if you see anything with substrate utilization, I draw

502
00:43:10,064 --> 00:43:13,169
these two graphs with the appropriate axes, right?

503
00:43:13,169 --> 00:43:14,984
Duration, time.

504
00:43:14,984 --> 00:43:18,869
intensity over there, draw these two, and then always reference

505
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:21,152
these two to make sure you're on the right track.

506
00:43:22,374 --> 00:43:26,419
Because it's pretty simple right now, but sometimes when you are

507
00:43:26,419 --> 00:43:30,664
in an exam and you have some test anxiety, maybe you accidentally flip them.

508
00:43:30,664 --> 00:43:33,508
But if you just draw it correctly, you're gonna have

509
00:43:33,508 --> 00:43:36,592
to fight yourself pretty hard to get the wrong answer here.

510
00:43:38,114 --> 00:43:40,317
Okay, so what's causing this decrease?

511
00:43:44,212 --> 00:43:45,693
Anyone remember the mechanisms?

512
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:54,702
Why are we decreasing this carbohydrate utilization?

513
00:43:54,702 --> 00:43:59,988
If I'm a marathon runner and I'm exercising a certain intensity, I prefer carbohydrates.

514
00:44:04,252 --> 00:44:10,498
Yeah, so I like that idea, but let's just assume that this is primarily oxidative or aerobic.

515
00:44:10,498 --> 00:44:11,299
I like that idea.

516
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:18,628
Yeah, you have a limited capacity or a limited supply bank for glycogen.

517
00:44:18,628 --> 00:44:20,030
Eventually you're gonna run out here.

518
00:44:21,433 --> 00:44:24,738
We also talked about the increase of epinephrine and how

519
00:44:24,738 --> 00:44:28,263
maybe that's going to free up more free fatty acids.

520
00:44:28,263 --> 00:44:36,156
But in general, the biggest piece here is you're starting to decrease the capacity for glycogen.

521
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,564
OK, what about the reasons here?

522
00:44:40,564 --> 00:44:41,786
Why are we increasing?

523
00:44:42,587 --> 00:44:46,633
Why does our body prefer carbohydrates during intense exercise?

524
00:44:50,779 --> 00:44:51,260
It's faster, right?

525
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:52,882
Yeah, it's faster.

526
00:44:52,882 --> 00:44:53,904
So there are less steps.

527
00:44:55,847 --> 00:44:56,989
Here we have glycogen.

528
00:44:56,989 --> 00:45:01,015
Break it down to G6P, glycolysis, Krebs cycle, ETC.

529
00:45:02,016 --> 00:45:03,178
Yeah, that's a lot of steps.

530
00:45:03,178 --> 00:45:04,540
But compare it to fat.

531
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:12,247
Adipose tissue is not even, the main triglyceride sources are not in the muscle.

532
00:45:12,247 --> 00:45:16,413
We gotta break down the triglycerides into free fatty acids away from the muscle.

533
00:45:17,895 --> 00:45:19,958
Then we gotta bring those free fatty acids closer to

534
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:26,686
the muscle, undergo beta oxidation, and then they get into a Krebs cycle, and then they go to ETC.

535
00:45:27,628 --> 00:45:28,889
So more steps.

536
00:45:28,889 --> 00:45:30,111
So that's one good reason.

537
00:45:30,111 --> 00:45:30,932
What's the second one?

538
00:45:35,992 --> 00:45:41,638
Yeah, yeah, so this caloric equivalent that you've been doing in lab, all this hard work

539
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:44,762
that you've been doing with the RER chart, you

540
00:45:44,762 --> 00:45:50,368
are more efficient at burning carbohydrates compared to fats.

541
00:45:50,368 --> 00:45:51,389
So you get the RER1.

542
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:55,734
So you get around 5 kcals per liter of oxygen

543
00:45:55,734 --> 00:46:02,101
when you're burning carbohydrates, and then closer to like 4.7 when you're dealing with fats.

544
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:03,743
Great, nice, nice.

545
00:46:03,743 --> 00:46:05,745
OK, so we're good here then.

546
00:46:07,092 --> 00:46:11,862
So then carbohydrate metabolism, one adequate glucose during

547
00:46:11,862 --> 00:46:17,434
exercise requires glucose release by the liver, as well as glucose uptake by the muscles.

548
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:26,113
The amount we release from the liver does depend on intensity and duration.

549
00:46:27,781 --> 00:46:29,845
The one thing we have to kind of keep in the back

550
00:46:29,845 --> 00:46:33,832
of our mind is as I increase exercise intensity, I am

551
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:38,440
almost decreasing the blood flow to these accessory organs.

552
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:43,028
That makes it harder for the liver to maybe release glucose

553
00:46:43,028 --> 00:46:46,093
in the same fashion at a submaximal or resting state.

554
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:53,657
Okay, hormones that increase circulating glucose, no surprise,

555
00:46:53,657 --> 00:46:55,780
because we already talked about it, growth hormone,

556
00:46:55,780 --> 00:47:02,347
cortisol, glucagon, and the catecholamines, epinephrine or epinephrine.

557
00:47:02,347 --> 00:47:07,574
This causes glycogenolysis, which means we're gonna break down glycogen into glucose.

558
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:11,698
We're also gonna undergo gluconeogenesis, this typically happens in

559
00:47:11,698 --> 00:47:16,384
the liver, where we take free fatty acids and proteins and create glucose molecules.

560
00:47:21,241 --> 00:47:26,646
OK, so catecholamines, if we look at each one of these

561
00:47:26,646 --> 00:47:30,010
here, we're going to go through each one of these hormones.

562
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:36,236
Catecholamines stimulate muscle and liver glycogenolysis, meaning we

563
00:47:36,236 --> 00:47:41,842
are going to take glycogen, break it down to glucose, and have that release into the blood system.

564
00:47:43,583 --> 00:47:50,370
So when we're talking about catecholamines, we're looking over here as far as carbohydrates.

565
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:01,668
So this happens by stimulating the beta-1 adrenergic receptor.

566
00:48:01,668 --> 00:48:03,090
And again, glucose levels go up.

567
00:48:05,794 --> 00:48:10,742
We typically use muscle glycogen before liver glycogen, only because of this blood flow issue.

568
00:48:18,393 --> 00:48:20,055
OK, so what about glucagon?

569
00:48:21,057 --> 00:48:24,100
Well, glucagon also stimulates the liver.

570
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,502
for glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.

571
00:48:27,943 --> 00:48:32,808
So the liver here is going to cause this creation of glucose here.

572
00:48:34,189 --> 00:48:35,390
Plasma glucose goes up.

573
00:48:38,593 --> 00:48:40,195
I think you're noticing a theme here.

574
00:48:41,316 --> 00:48:42,717
They're all kind of doing the same thing.

575
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:49,163
But here we talked about how catecholamines are meeting at the liver and the muscle.

576
00:48:50,984 --> 00:48:53,787
Glucagon here are kind of stimulating the liver.

577
00:48:56,669 --> 00:48:58,772
Same picture here, basically, with epinephrine

578
00:48:58,772 --> 00:49:02,979
glucagon stimulates liver glycogenolysis gluconeogenesis to cause

579
00:49:02,979 --> 00:49:05,624
an increase in glucose concentration in the blood.

580
00:49:12,515 --> 00:49:13,677
Okay, what about growth hormone?

581
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:20,989
Well, growth hormone is also meeting at the liver and causing gluconeogenesis.

582
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:27,028
If we are looking at gluconeogenesis with growth hormone, glucose levels also increase.

583
00:49:28,169 --> 00:49:28,870
Same story here.

584
00:49:34,819 --> 00:49:39,386
Cortisol doesn't wanna be left out, so it's joining club liver over here,

585
00:49:39,386 --> 00:49:42,551
and it's gonna meet at the liver, and it's also gonna

586
00:49:42,551 --> 00:49:47,078
do the same thing, stimulate the liver to increase glucose secretion.

587
00:49:51,428 --> 00:49:55,773
So circulating glucose during exercise also is impacted by

588
00:49:55,773 --> 00:49:59,878
increasing in free fatty oxidation and decrease glucose uptake.

589
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:08,408
If I am uptaking free fatty acids and not uptaking

590
00:50:08,408 --> 00:50:14,955
as many glucose molecules, then by default glucose will increase inside of the blood.

591
00:50:24,503 --> 00:50:25,184
Okay, so far?

592
00:50:27,007 --> 00:50:28,449
All right, let's talk about this one.

593
00:50:28,449 --> 00:50:30,913
We'll take a few minutes here, talk with your neighbors.

594
00:50:30,913 --> 00:50:33,999
Growth hormone, epinephrine or epinephrine, and cortisol

595
00:50:33,999 --> 00:50:41,010
all inhibit glucose uptake during exercise, causing the body to rely more on free fatty acids.

596
00:50:42,627 --> 00:50:45,674
Which tissues do we want to inhibit glucose uptake during

597
00:50:45,674 --> 00:50:51,428
exercise, and which tissues do we not want to inhibit glucose uptake during exercise?

598
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:55,017
So just a minute or two, and then we'll come back together here.

599
00:51:44,288 --> 00:51:47,993
Okay, I think it's pretty straightforward, but who wants to help me out with this one?

600
00:51:49,495 --> 00:51:53,440
Which tissues do we want to inhibit glucose uptake during exercise?

601
00:51:58,207 --> 00:51:58,747
Any ideas?

602
00:52:03,434 --> 00:52:07,579
Or maybe the easier one, which tissues do we not want to inhibit glucose uptake?

603
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:11,255
The brain, that would be a good one, yeah.

604
00:52:11,255 --> 00:52:13,722
But in general, where else?

605
00:52:13,722 --> 00:52:15,327
Where else do we want glucose uptake?

606
00:52:15,327 --> 00:52:18,978
That is a good one, though.

607
00:52:18,978 --> 00:52:19,961
The muscles, right?

608
00:52:19,961 --> 00:52:23,489
We want the muscles to be able to uptake.

609
00:52:23,489 --> 00:52:27,714
It's a little interesting with nervous tissue, especially during exercise.

610
00:52:27,714 --> 00:52:32,700
They are a net uptake uptaker of lactate as

611
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,223
opposed to glucose, and they actually metabolize lactate.

612
00:52:36,184 --> 00:52:40,609
So yes, they do increase glucose uptake and utilization,

613
00:52:40,609 --> 00:52:43,652
but they primarily rely on lactate, especially during exercise.

614
00:52:44,894 --> 00:52:47,757
What about the tissues we want to inhibit glucose uptake?

615
00:52:50,941 --> 00:52:52,062
Kind of on that same point.

616
00:52:56,513 --> 00:53:02,241
Yeah, yeah, tissues that aren't necessarily being used to do the mechanical work.

617
00:53:02,241 --> 00:53:05,126
So inactive tissue is sometimes what we call it.

618
00:53:05,126 --> 00:53:07,790
Because you have to think about it in the extreme way.

619
00:53:08,611 --> 00:53:12,857
If I'm running from a bear, then I want all the

620
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:16,262
glucose to go to the muscle, not necessarily anywhere else.

621
00:53:17,664 --> 00:53:21,750
Yes, that could be bad, especially if I'm reduced to, say, neural tissue.

622
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:24,020
But at that point, it's like,

623
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,564
Either you run away or you don't run away because you

624
00:53:26,564 --> 00:53:31,934
don't have enough energy at the muscles and then your life is at stake.

625
00:53:31,934 --> 00:53:36,201
OK, so let's look at the change in these hormone concentrations during three hours of cycling.

626
00:53:37,263 --> 00:53:40,769
Interestingly enough, look at glucose down here.

627
00:53:40,769 --> 00:53:43,915
So we have time on the x-axis and then percent change.

628
00:53:44,977 --> 00:53:48,643
We actually see blood glucose levels remain quite steady here.

629
00:53:51,222 --> 00:53:54,266
And then of course, we're seeing all of our hormones go up.

630
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:10,210
I just told you though, we're getting an increase in these hormones that result in what?

631
00:54:12,637 --> 00:54:18,563
What should that, I guess, I just told you about all the party that was at the liver,

632
00:54:18,563 --> 00:54:20,966
and the liver's trying to release all this glucose, so

633
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:26,772
we should expect glucose levels to be much higher, but it's not.

634
00:54:26,772 --> 00:54:27,052
Why?

635
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:33,539
Yeah, yeah, it's kind of like a rate of appearance,

636
00:54:33,539 --> 00:54:37,783
rate of disappearance, like we talked about on lactate.

637
00:54:39,552 --> 00:54:43,577
glucose uptake by the muscles is occurring at the same time.

638
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:51,768
So during exercise, insulin enables glucose uptake in the

639
00:54:51,768 --> 00:54:56,834
muscles, but what did we learn about insulin concentration?

640
00:54:58,616 --> 00:54:59,998
It goes down.

641
00:54:59,998 --> 00:55:01,620
Insulin concentrations go down.

642
00:55:03,503 --> 00:55:06,927
The nice thing though, insulin sensitivity goes up,

643
00:55:08,206 --> 00:55:12,132
but we get more glucose uptake into the cells, but use less insulin.

644
00:55:13,434 --> 00:55:15,938
What is going on, right?

645
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,462
I thought we needed insulin.

646
00:55:19,604 --> 00:55:22,408
Well, before we get into this, let's just talk about what insulin does.

647
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:27,115
Insulin stimulates glucose uptake in the muscle cells.

648
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:33,285
So if we are acting on the muscle with insulin, that's gonna cause glucose to enter that cell.

649
00:55:37,113 --> 00:55:39,956
If we look at changes in plasma glucose and insulin during

650
00:55:39,956 --> 00:55:45,163
prolonged cycling at 65, 70% of the O2 max, this is glucose on

651
00:55:45,163 --> 00:55:49,228
the left Y, insulin on the right Y, and then time over here.

652
00:55:50,509 --> 00:55:55,716
Just like I mentioned before, insulin goes down with prolonged exercise.

653
00:55:57,678 --> 00:56:01,102
And again, this is a very small magnitude, but look at this.

654
00:56:02,604 --> 00:56:04,386
Glucose is kind of going up.

655
00:56:07,471 --> 00:56:08,172
That's weird.

656
00:56:09,635 --> 00:56:10,376
Let's think about this.

657
00:56:10,376 --> 00:56:15,123
Plasma insulin decreases with prolonged or the uptake of glucose is going up.

658
00:56:16,265 --> 00:56:19,130
So here we're kind of uptaking it inside of the muscle here.

659
00:56:20,112 --> 00:56:23,838
Plasma insulin decreases with prolonged so maximal exercise,

660
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:31,330
yet the exercising muscle takes up seven to 20 times faster than at rest.

661
00:56:33,213 --> 00:56:34,575
How is this possible?

662
00:56:35,804 --> 00:56:38,451
when the underlying hormone is going down.

663
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:44,809
So let's maybe talk for a couple minutes, come up with

664
00:56:44,809 --> 00:56:46,995
some ideas, and we'll come back together on this.

665
00:58:45,353 --> 00:58:48,058
Okay, how are we doing here?

666
00:58:50,081 --> 00:58:55,871
So just as a recap, during exercise, prolonged

667
00:58:55,871 --> 00:59:06,108
or graded, cortisol, glucagon, catecholamines, all of these hormones are going up.

668
00:59:08,091 --> 00:59:09,994
What is the role of those hormones?

669
00:59:12,151 --> 00:59:18,060
release glucose, so we should expect to see glucose to increase.

670
00:59:18,961 --> 00:59:21,565
We don't necessarily see the increase, we see it steady.

671
00:59:22,647 --> 00:59:26,733
That means something causing it to bring it into the cell.

672
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:28,856
But if I have all this excess glucose inside of

673
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:34,405
the blood, what's the only hormone that's gonna get it, get

674
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:37,770
the cells to respond to bring the glucose into the cell?

675
00:59:39,016 --> 00:59:41,562
Insulin, what happens to insulin during graded?

676
00:59:41,562 --> 00:59:42,805
It goes down.

677
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:45,352
What the heck?

678
00:59:47,677 --> 00:59:48,920
Any ideas of what's causing this?

679
00:59:54,294 --> 00:59:54,915
Yep, keep going.

680
01:00:05,105 --> 01:00:06,487
Ooh, I see what you were saying.

681
01:00:06,487 --> 01:00:11,214
So you're saying the insulin decreases due to the binding of the receptors.

682
01:00:11,214 --> 01:00:12,716
Is that kind of where you're going at?

683
01:00:12,716 --> 01:00:15,399
So that's not quite what's going on, but yeah, that does happen.

684
01:00:15,399 --> 01:00:19,045
So we become a little bit more sensitive to the insulin that we do have on board.

685
01:00:19,045 --> 01:00:25,233
So if we are increasing the insulin sensitivity, we almost need less insulin to do the same job.

686
01:00:25,233 --> 01:00:29,700
But that still wouldn't explain maybe the 10-fold decrease,

687
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:33,525
and then we're having such a large uptake of glucose.

688
01:00:34,822 --> 01:00:37,446
And it's nothing that we really talked about in lecture so far.

689
01:00:37,446 --> 01:00:38,607
I'm just curious of anyone.

690
01:00:49,022 --> 01:00:52,947
Yeah, so let's just assume the insulin levels are very minor.

691
01:00:54,169 --> 01:00:59,176
And they're so low that it does not account for all of this.

692
01:00:59,176 --> 01:01:04,117
So even if we have an increased insulin sensitivity, the decrease in insulin

693
01:01:04,117 --> 01:01:08,083
would we would expect to see a decrease in glucose uptake?

694
01:01:12,629 --> 01:01:16,154
Not quite because we still need those transporters on the cell.

695
01:01:16,154 --> 01:01:20,160
So insulin binds to the receptor, causes a secondary messenger system.

696
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,664
You get the GLUT4 transporters inside of the cell.

697
01:01:22,664 --> 01:01:29,213
They translocate to the surface and those GLUT4 transporters are what's bringing in the glucose.

698
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:47,826
Yeah, yeah, so you're pretty much right on there.

699
01:01:49,409 --> 01:01:54,094
We get Glut4 translocation in the skeletal muscle.

700
01:01:54,094 --> 01:01:56,376
So here on the left, we have insulin.

701
01:01:56,376 --> 01:01:59,680
So insulin binds to the receptor, secondary cascade.

702
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,823
And then we get these Glut4 receptors or transporters.

703
01:02:02,823 --> 01:02:04,725
They translocate to the membrane.

704
01:02:04,725 --> 01:02:07,588
And then we can start bringing in glucose to the cell.

705
01:02:10,511 --> 01:02:12,493
Independent of insulin.

706
01:02:14,896 --> 01:02:19,396
Exercise causes

707
01:02:19,396 --> 01:02:23,020
the same translocation of these Glut4 transporters to the

708
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:29,166
surface of the membrane, and allows for glucose to be entering the cell.

709
01:02:30,888 --> 01:02:33,310
You may have heard this term, this term is a little

710
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:40,557
bit newer, but we have, well, you've heard of this, this term's not new, but cytokines, what are those?

711
01:02:40,557 --> 01:02:41,679
Does anyone remember what those are?

712
01:02:43,741 --> 01:02:44,622
What are cytokines?

713
01:02:47,685 --> 01:02:47,985
Anyone?

714
01:02:52,133 --> 01:02:58,383
Yeah, it's basically the immune system releasing out some chemicals to cause some immune response.

715
01:02:59,185 --> 01:03:02,951
The muscle has something called myokines.

716
01:03:03,772 --> 01:03:07,698
So these myokines are being released during contraction.

717
01:03:09,101 --> 01:03:11,104
We don't really know

718
01:03:11,962 --> 01:03:17,109
or have a, we have an idea, but we haven't really established what those are.

719
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:19,632
We just kind of termed them myokines.

720
01:03:19,632 --> 01:03:25,079
And those myokines are then interacting with these Glut4 receptors to cause them to translocate.

721
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:30,166
Whoa, that's pretty cool, right?

722
01:03:30,166 --> 01:03:32,910
Like now we have two separate pieces.

723
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:36,855
Yes, insulin goes down, so we still have a little bit of insulin.

724
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,308
and that's still doing its job, but that's not accounting

725
01:03:40,308 --> 01:03:43,136
for the large uptake of glucose in the muscles.

726
01:03:43,136 --> 01:03:45,564
Instead, we have these myokines being released due to

727
01:03:45,564 --> 01:03:51,823
contraction and some other factors that are causing the Glut4 receptors to translocate.

728
01:03:53,187 --> 01:03:56,892
Okay, so let's look at this study here, kind of following up on that.

729
01:03:56,892 --> 01:04:01,939
Progressive increase in glucose transporter, Glut4, in human sarcolymum vesicles.

730
01:04:01,939 --> 01:04:05,884
So basically on the muscles during five and 40 minutes of exercise.

731
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:07,806
So here we have zero, five, and 40.

732
01:04:10,891 --> 01:04:17,279
So we're seeing the Glut4 transporters increase.

733
01:04:17,279 --> 01:04:19,482
We are seeing this increase.

734
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:27,417
If I clamp insulin, so this was a pretty cool study, where we're trying to see

735
01:04:27,417 --> 01:04:32,947
if I clamp insulin or I remove the impact of insulin,

736
01:04:35,331 --> 01:04:40,661
how much glucose am I uptaking just from exercise alone?

737
01:04:41,863 --> 01:04:43,005
And it's this much.

738
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:47,430
Insulin definitely does a better job, so insulin alone does

739
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:52,156
a better job, but exercise still does a really good job.

740
01:04:52,156 --> 01:04:55,420
And the cool part is, is they have an additive effect.

741
01:04:56,721 --> 01:05:00,105
So if I then add insulin plus exercise, so those

742
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:08,976
myokines and insulin, I get a much larger response, so we get a much larger glucose uptake.

743
01:05:17,174 --> 01:05:21,358
So this is pretty cool because anyone know

744
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:26,103
something interesting about insulin sensitivity in certain disease populations?

745
01:05:32,469 --> 01:05:38,174
Yeah, so type two diabetes, those individuals have insulin sensitivity issues.

746
01:05:39,956 --> 01:05:42,979
Well, exercise can help with that.

747
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:47,686
So even though they're having trouble responding to the insulin,

748
01:05:48,867 --> 01:05:53,013
exercise is one of the only other things that they can

749
01:05:53,013 --> 01:05:58,261
do to really help with insulin sensitivity as well as regulating those glucose levels.

750
01:05:59,302 --> 01:06:03,609
So with, and we'll get into this a little bit later, but with regular exercise training,

751
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:07,715
depending on the situation, obviously certain things can go

752
01:06:07,715 --> 01:06:11,380
too far where you have physical disruption of organs.

753
01:06:12,288 --> 01:06:16,419
But this is a really good reason why type 2

754
01:06:16,419 --> 01:06:21,893
diabetic patients can improve insulin sensitivity and almost kind

755
01:06:21,893 --> 01:06:27,748
of revert back to normality if they undergo a normal exercise regimen.

756
01:06:31,694 --> 01:06:33,376
Okay the one thing we also have to keep in mind,

757
01:06:33,376 --> 01:06:37,682
blood flow, increasing blood flow activity to the muscles

758
01:06:37,682 --> 01:06:42,909
during exercise results in an increased delivery of insulin despite the lower concentration.

759
01:06:42,909 --> 01:06:46,154
So I know someone had mentioned this too, it's like a concentration gradient.

760
01:06:46,154 --> 01:06:50,580
So even though we have a small amount of insulin, well it's like the reverse effect.

761
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,636
of some of the other hormones acting on the liver.

762
01:06:53,636 --> 01:06:58,201
Well, we're restricting blood flow to the liver, and we're sending a lot of blood to the muscles.

763
01:06:58,201 --> 01:07:02,044
Well, even though I have a decreased insulin concentration, a

764
01:07:02,044 --> 01:07:06,469
lot of blood's going to that area, so you kind of get this increase in insulin sensitivity.

765
01:07:08,451 --> 01:07:10,733
So two pieces, right?

766
01:07:10,733 --> 01:07:14,497
You get that increased insulin sensitivity, as well as

767
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:18,561
the GLUT4 translocation due to exercise in itself.

768
01:07:18,561 --> 01:07:21,357
Those two are independent.

769
01:07:21,357 --> 01:07:26,328
but they can be additive to get a much greater effect.

770
01:07:26,328 --> 01:07:27,010
Pretty cool, right?

771
01:07:28,373 --> 01:07:29,094
I think it's pretty cool.

772
01:07:30,237 --> 01:07:31,780
OK, so we'll stop here.

773
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:34,546
We'll pick up for the rest of the slides on Thursday.

774
01:07:35,388 --> 01:07:37,012
Please let me know if you have any questions.

775
01:07:37,874 --> 01:07:38,876
Stay warm.

776
01:07:38,876 --> 01:07:40,159
Enjoy the rest of your day.
