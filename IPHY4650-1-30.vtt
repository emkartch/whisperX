WEBVTT

03:47.534 --> 03:48.035
All right.

03:50.477 --> 03:51.277
Let's get started.

03:52.599 --> 03:53.379
Good to see you all.

03:54.961 --> 04:00.766
Not sure if we are gonna get a big snowstorm today, but we'll see how that weather goes.

04:01.406 --> 04:06.831
Hopefully you're doing okay and that the second week of labs was good.

04:08.413 --> 04:10.695
It was a little bit of probably

04:12.592 --> 04:15.054
not a wake-up or anything like that, but it was a lot of calculations.

04:15.635 --> 04:18.997
You're gonna have a very similar calculation-based lab next week.

04:19.378 --> 04:25.182
And then after that, the amount of calculations, especially like the Haldane equation, goes way down.

04:25.302 --> 04:27.904
So don't worry, not every lab is gonna be like that.

04:28.485 --> 04:35.871
You should have plenty of time in the future labs to complete the majority, if not all, of the lab and turn it in during that time.

04:35.931 --> 04:37.652
So just hang tight.

04:37.672 --> 04:41.175
We gotta get through these calculations before we move on to the fun stuff.

04:42.477 --> 04:46.001
Second piece, what's in two weeks, two Thursdays from now?

04:47.263 --> 04:48.524
Yeah, your first exam.

04:48.544 --> 04:54.752
So your first lecture exam is in two Thursdays from today, so February 13th.

04:54.912 --> 04:56.914
So please try to keep that in mind.

04:57.615 --> 05:02.100
One of the big things that I like to say right off the bat would be,

05:03.507 --> 05:06.970
I don't know if you're struggling unless you tell me.

05:07.530 --> 05:15.017
And so you want to get some things cleared up now before you find out on the exam if you struggle on the exam.

05:15.597 --> 05:29.229
So I highly recommend if there are any slides or concepts or thought questions or study guide questions that are not making sense that we need to talk about it so we can clear that up.

05:30.970 --> 05:31.711
Are we okay with that?

05:32.573 --> 05:45.599
All right, and that does remind me since we are getting closer to the exams, this is spring semester, I know many of you are trying to graduate, and I know all of you care about your grade, but one thing I like to say is,

05:47.600 --> 05:53.985
So I don't curve the class, because typically, like if it was below a certain amount, like the syllabus says, yeah, we will curve it.

05:54.005 --> 05:55.806
But we don't round grades up.

05:55.866 --> 05:57.067
We don't do anything like that.

05:57.907 --> 06:09.395
But if people are on the edge, some of the things that I do look for are like participation or at least attendance in lecture, as well as participation or attendance in lab.

06:10.095 --> 06:11.336
So I do check those.

06:11.897 --> 06:13.258
And so it's really good.

06:13.318 --> 06:20.304
And I know sometimes it's hard because there are bigger groups this semester, but it's very easy to kind of tuck away and kind of hide in the background.

06:21.245 --> 06:23.627
But I'm going to tell you right now, all your TAs can see that.

06:23.907 --> 06:27.250
So all these small little things do add up.

06:28.010 --> 06:29.171
And if you are on the edge,

06:30.288 --> 06:37.716
Right, we typically don't round, but those do make a big factor in some of those decisions.

06:38.237 --> 06:39.378
So try to keep that in mind.

06:39.778 --> 06:44.023
You're already in lab, you might as well try to learn something and try to enjoy the lab.

06:44.463 --> 06:45.144
Same with lecture.

06:46.085 --> 06:46.766
Are we okay there?

06:47.487 --> 06:48.368
Okay, nice.

06:49.236 --> 06:53.699
All right, so we're gonna try to finish off bioenergetics and exercise metabolism.

06:54.380 --> 07:15.416
Quick review, we learned on Tuesday that exercise duration and fuel selection, if we're just looking at expanding the duration, so the duration of the exercise itself, as the duration increases, we shift from carbohydrate utilization towards fat utilization.

07:17.485 --> 07:19.166
So we ran through some clicker questions.

07:19.226 --> 07:19.947
We looked at that.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.208
Now we want to know why.

07:23.070 --> 07:27.253
So most of this is due to an increased rate of lipolysis.

07:28.013 --> 07:30.676
And lipolysis, again, is the breakdown of triglycerides.

07:31.296 --> 07:42.025
We are mainly not really worried too much about this glycerol, but the pre-fatty acids.

07:43.250 --> 07:57.861
These different lipases are freeing up these free fatty acids from the triglycerides so then we can undergo beta oxidation, get them into acetyl-CoA and then run them through the Krebs cycle and then eventually to the ETC.

07:59.722 --> 08:10.110
The rate of lipolysis increases as we increase the concentration of hormones like epinephrine and norepinephrine.

08:11.626 --> 08:27.736
Here, if we have duration and percent change of the hormone of interest, which is epinephrine or epinephrine, we could see that they substantially increase over time at the same exercise intensity.

08:28.557 --> 08:33.400
So we're not changing the exercise intensity here, just increasing the duration.

08:41.205 --> 08:42.526
So then what does this look like?

08:42.847 --> 08:44.268
Well, it looks something like this.

08:45.249 --> 08:47.451
This is a nice little piece here to add in.

08:47.911 --> 08:51.174
We are looking at submaximal exercise, not maximal exercise.

08:52.395 --> 09:03.225
Anytime we are doing any kind of substrate utilization, it needs to be primarily oxidative phosphorylation, submaximal, constant work rate.

09:04.726 --> 09:04.927
Okay.

09:06.467 --> 09:11.948
This is your substrate utilization in percent, exercise duration over here.

09:12.908 --> 09:20.049
As exercise duration increases, we see a decrease in carbohydrate utilization and an increase in fat utilization.

09:20.769 --> 09:27.431
One of those mechanisms is because we're increasing lipolysis due to the increased secretion of epinephrine.

09:29.911 --> 09:34.992
From a storage standpoint, so number two, second reason, from a storage standpoint,

09:36.862 --> 09:41.303
Which one of these do we have more or less an unlimited source?

09:44.924 --> 09:45.224
Fats.

09:45.604 --> 09:47.024
Yeah, so what about carbohydrates?

09:48.484 --> 09:48.684
No.

09:49.085 --> 09:50.485
What do we store carbohydrates in?

09:51.165 --> 09:51.565
Or as?

09:52.105 --> 09:52.485
What form?

09:53.005 --> 09:53.525
Glycogen.

09:55.206 --> 10:05.388
Another large factor to this decrease in carbohydrate utilization as we increase in exercise duration is we are depleting those glycogen stores.

10:08.597 --> 10:15.099
Glycogen depletion during exercise does depend on intensity, but it also is impacted by time.

10:16.040 --> 10:24.763
Since we are on the duration piece, we'll kind of focus on the duration for now, but just kind of keep in mind that it works at every single intensity.

10:25.603 --> 10:28.645
So here in these little boxes, we have intensity.

10:28.685 --> 10:33.188
So this is 120% of max, 90%, 75, 60, and 30.

10:33.828 --> 10:39.892
And this is glycogen depletion here on the y-axis and then duration or time on the x-axis.

10:41.173 --> 10:44.195
We can see that at every intensity it decreases.

10:46.046 --> 10:49.627
as far as glycogen content with exercise duration.

10:50.347 --> 10:55.868
But we see the largest magnitude in decrease at the 75% intensity.

10:57.268 --> 11:02.029
But I guess the point is, is as you increase in duration, you are depleting those glycogen stores.

11:06.570 --> 11:11.271
If you run out of glycogen or deplete them to a certain level,

11:12.570 --> 11:19.711
you have to rely on other energy stores, which would be this fat utilization over here.

11:28.473 --> 11:28.753
Okay.

11:30.613 --> 11:36.374
So this does not change our model of as exercise intensity increases, we prefer carbohydrates.

11:37.674 --> 11:40.815
It's just we're running out of those carbohydrates with duration.

11:43.235 --> 11:52.820
This is kind of telling the same story, declining the gas drop muscle for glycogen content for three hours of treadmill exercise running at 70% VO2 max.

11:53.360 --> 12:06.247
We see the muscle glycogen decreases, and as we have that decrease in muscle glycogen, it seems like we are working harder, or the perceived exertion here on this y-axis is much higher.

12:08.804 --> 12:20.989
It is interesting though that until about 50 millimoles per kilogram, there wasn't a large or a change in this increase of the rating of perceived exertion.

12:22.530 --> 12:30.033
And I think most of us who have exercised for this long of a duration, maybe one hour to two hour, you may have felt this if you weren't feeding.

12:31.315 --> 12:37.741
So you're exercising, you're feeling pretty good, and then all of a sudden you're like, whoa, I'm in really bad shape here.

12:37.861 --> 12:38.722
I need to feed.

12:38.842 --> 12:45.308
But by that time, you're kind of out of luck, and you have to really decrease that exercise intensity.

12:45.888 --> 12:51.913
Sometimes that's called hitting the wall, or you're bonking, and you really, no matter what, you can try to feed.

12:51.953 --> 12:55.817
But at that point in time, you have to decrease that exercise intensity.

12:59.922 --> 13:02.324
Another kind of figure of the same concept.

13:02.384 --> 13:02.624
Oh, yeah.

13:05.746 --> 13:06.326
Yeah, yeah.

13:06.526 --> 13:07.747
And we'll talk about feeding.

13:07.807 --> 13:12.730
But yeah, as you feed, that really makes a very large difference in this model.

13:18.778 --> 13:24.621
Well, if you are supplying carbohydrates, then you can almost spare some of the glycogen molecules.

13:25.382 --> 13:27.983
You can push this curve a little bit further.

13:28.644 --> 13:36.208
So instead of muscle glycogen ending at four hours, maybe it'll end over here at six, but maybe you're not even exercising for six hours.

13:36.308 --> 13:38.029
So you would never run into that problem.

13:38.810 --> 13:39.410
It's a great question.

13:40.871 --> 13:50.721
So here if we have the two major substrates but broken down in kind of locations, we have muscle triglycerides, plasma-free fatty acids, and then blood glucose and muscle glycogen.

13:51.522 --> 14:01.692
So we can think of this 50% here just like what we saw on that previous figure of fat utilization and carbohydrate utilization right around 50-50, because all of this would be carbohydrate.

14:02.825 --> 14:17.837
They all decrease here, but as we start to deplete our glycogen levels, we are more and more becoming reliant on our glucose levels, which is generally not a great thing because we need to tightly regulate our blood glucose levels.

14:18.477 --> 14:20.519
But they have to pull that energy from somewhere.

14:22.040 --> 14:28.025
No surprise, we're becoming more reliant on the free fatty acids, the plasma free fatty acids.

14:32.033 --> 14:38.216
And so we kind of talked about this a little bit based on your classmates question.

14:39.437 --> 14:46.420
But if muscle glycogen levels are limited during prolonged low intensity exercise, what can an athlete do to delay the fatigue in a race?

14:48.581 --> 14:51.743
We don't have to break off into groups because we just kind of talked about it.

14:53.344 --> 14:54.504
But remind me, what can we do?

14:54.725 --> 14:55.425
There's a few things.

14:56.485 --> 14:57.926
Yeah, you can feed, right?

14:58.626 --> 15:04.730
You can eat and try to maintain some of these blood glucose and glycogen levels.

15:04.770 --> 15:08.932
What else could we do, but if it's an athlete they really don't wanna do it?

15:11.454 --> 15:12.375
Slow down, yeah.

15:12.695 --> 15:22.901
Eventually you can't maintain that exercise intensity, so maybe you have to slow down so you're relying on more fats to produce the energy to sustain that exercise as opposed to carbohydrates.

15:23.681 --> 15:24.642
That's good, good.

15:27.274 --> 15:33.758
OK, I know I'm just almost repeating the same thing over and over, but this is how important these concepts are.

15:33.838 --> 15:38.140
But again, exercise duration on muscle fuel source.

15:38.701 --> 15:46.565
We start to deplete those glycogen levels, so we need to rely more and more on plasma-free fatty acids.

15:46.885 --> 15:48.186
And that's why this one comes way up.

15:56.110 --> 15:58.111
Okay, so are we kinda stuck where we're at?

15:58.571 --> 16:09.436
No, not really, because if we can train or undergo repeated bouts over time of endurance exercise training, we can shift this curve.

16:10.316 --> 16:22.041
And how this curve shifts, if we're just looking at fat oxidation here on the y-axis, so I've kinda taken away carbohydrate to make this a little bit easier to look at, if we start at this bottom curve,

16:23.560 --> 16:27.902
after training, we shift the curve up and to the left.

16:28.402 --> 16:29.863
So up and to the left over here.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.324
So that's what this arrow is indicating.

16:34.545 --> 16:39.607
The nice thing about this would be now I can take any duration

16:41.450 --> 16:43.993
draw a line straight up, so say three hours.

16:44.193 --> 16:49.700
This was my old line and I was at 48% oxidation.

16:50.221 --> 16:53.484
And I come back up to here after training, I'm at 50 or 60, 58, 60% oxidation.

16:59.611 --> 17:04.234
So if you're ever like, oh, man, I kind of forgot after training, where does the curve shift?

17:04.675 --> 17:14.281
Well, if I drew the curve down below and you just drew a line up, you would see you're burning less fat after training if you drew it incorrectly on the bottom.

17:14.841 --> 17:27.150
And so it's pretty straightforward as far as if you have the underlying concept and you draw the curve correctly, or if you have the curve incorrect and you have the underlying concept, you can correct that pretty quickly.

17:29.170 --> 17:37.135
So I think draw the curve, draw a line straight up, and you can kind of see which one is improving after training.

17:43.359 --> 17:50.223
Any questions on substrate utilization as we are increasing duration or time?

17:52.465 --> 17:52.605
Yeah.

17:59.880 --> 18:02.262
like the output level of the athletes?

18:03.544 --> 18:11.270
So you're saying that as I train, if I'm utilizing more fat, I'm at a disadvantage?

18:11.491 --> 18:12.612
Is that kind of what you're getting at?

18:14.013 --> 18:14.273
Yeah.

18:14.353 --> 18:19.698
So in this instance, one thing, and this is a great question, because we're at the same exercise intensity here.

18:20.839 --> 18:25.684
So at the same exercise intensity, we see an increase in fat utilization with training.

18:26.646 --> 18:29.787
But that just means with training I can run faster.

18:30.887 --> 18:39.990
So then I'd be at a higher absolute speed and I'd be able to maintain the same rate of fat oxidation versus carbohydrate if I push myself on a higher intensity scale.

18:41.351 --> 18:48.353
So what this ends up doing is it actually spares your glycogen molecules at a much higher rate for an endurance trained athlete.

18:54.132 --> 18:58.876
I guess, like what's the duration of the training like before that?

18:58.896 --> 19:06.481
Yeah, it depends a little bit, but most of the studies have six to eight weeks of training and they publish those results.

19:07.262 --> 19:14.448
There are individuals who need a little bit less and especially if someone was already endurance trained and then they took a big break and then they went back.

19:14.868 --> 19:17.850
We'll talk about how athletes kind of bounce back a little bit faster.

19:17.910 --> 19:23.815
But in general, six to eight weeks would be where the majority of the research lands in this kind of area, yeah.

19:29.745 --> 19:33.487
Well, so when you say switch, they're always utilizing fat.

19:33.527 --> 19:40.470
They're just doing it at a higher percentage after training compared to before training at the same exercise intensity.

19:41.171 --> 19:48.534
But if you put them at a higher exercise intensity, well, that changes because on that spectrum, you're still going to have an increase in carbohydrate utilization.

19:49.755 --> 19:50.235
Great question.

19:50.435 --> 19:52.156
I think there was another one above.

19:52.476 --> 19:53.636
And it's OK if you don't have it again?

19:54.497 --> 19:54.597
Yep.

20:07.548 --> 20:14.195
Yeah, so not necessarily aerobic versus anaerobic, but we would almost say the rate of perceived exertion would be lower.

20:14.255 --> 20:15.916
It'd feel a little bit easier.

20:16.297 --> 20:18.719
And I think we've all experienced this with some sort of training.

20:19.079 --> 20:20.961
You run at five miles per hour every day.

20:21.562 --> 20:27.928
Maybe the first day is kind of hard, but then two months later, you're like, oh, five miles per hour is not that bad anymore.

20:28.168 --> 20:29.810
And so that kind of happens.

20:30.791 --> 20:40.214
The whole time, you're still primarily oxidative, as long as you're getting past a certain duration, which we kind of talked about on Tuesday, where that halfway point is around two to three minutes.

20:41.054 --> 20:44.475
After that, you're primarily using oxidative sources.

20:45.036 --> 20:46.076
Yeah, that's good.

20:50.596 --> 20:51.136
Okay, great.

20:51.977 --> 20:53.458
Okay, so this is duration.

20:54.439 --> 20:57.121
Now let's look at what happens with intensity.

20:58.041 --> 21:01.604
We've kind of already talked about this as we were talking about duration.

21:02.905 --> 21:10.971
But for graded exercise, when I say graded exercise, we're talking about an incremental increase in exercise intensity.

21:13.121 --> 21:38.102
Just because we are increasing the exercise intensity does not necessarily mean we're talking about anaerobic versus aerobic, but with a lot of these exercise intensities, we are trying to say, well, at least they're exercising for around four to 10 minutes, which is why ATP produced is primarily from aerobic or oxidative metabolism.

21:41.301 --> 22:02.090
Once you reach a certain point where you plateau, which is kind of this next slide here, so as I increase the workload here on the X axis, we are increasing our oxygen consumption on the Y. Well, that makes sense because we need more oxygen to then undergo metabolism to produce more ATP, but eventually,

22:03.658 --> 22:14.189
We reach a point where even if I increase the workload or the power, there's no increase in oxygen consumption.

22:16.171 --> 22:22.698
We'll touch on where the barriers are that are limiting your body's ability to uptake more oxygen.

22:24.043 --> 22:33.611
But some of the more easier ones to think about is, well, my lungs are just the size that I have.

22:33.651 --> 22:36.093
My heart can't really get that much bigger.

22:36.253 --> 22:38.115
Well, they don't get bigger on the outside.

22:38.695 --> 22:41.117
You can have some hypertrophy inside of the ventricles.

22:41.878 --> 22:45.841
But you have the lungs that you are born with, and you have the heart that you're born with.

22:45.922 --> 22:50.826
And so at a certain point in time, I can't bring enough oxygen in, or maybe I can't pump enough blood.

22:51.857 --> 23:02.703
So those are a couple limitations, but eventually your body cannot absorb or consume more oxygen, no matter the power that I kind of put that individual on.

23:03.163 --> 23:05.505
And so they reach a physiological ceiling.

23:08.866 --> 23:18.292
So some of those factors, maximum ability of cardiorespiratory system to deliver oxygen to the muscles, or the ability of the muscles to use the oxygen and produce ATP aerobically.

23:19.252 --> 23:20.753
So you can imagine if I had

23:24.047 --> 23:34.620
a well-developed heart, lungs, blood, and all of that, but then all of a sudden I take away half your mitochondria, well, that could be a problem for you to actually consume that oxygen.

23:35.561 --> 23:37.343
So that's what that bottom one's kind of talking about.

23:42.538 --> 23:46.421
Okay, exercise intensity and fuel selection at low intensity exercise.

23:46.841 --> 23:49.864
Fats are the primary fuel that is being utilized.

23:50.304 --> 23:54.628
At high exercise intensity, carbohydrates are the primary fuel.

23:58.330 --> 24:03.254
We kinda talked about this before, so this should be a little bit of review, and I think you've seen this in your labs as well.

24:05.516 --> 24:10.280
Which is why I know this question's gonna be on your exam then.

24:14.342 --> 24:19.527
You're going to get 100 here, and we're going to put this on the exam here.

24:20.388 --> 24:24.372
What happens to R or RER as exercise intensity increases?

25:18.227 --> 25:21.328
OK, let's go maybe 30, 45 seconds more.

25:23.430 --> 25:27.391
Does anyone need more help setting this up or setting your clicker up?

25:50.593 --> 25:51.773
All right, 30 more seconds.

25:52.113 --> 25:53.654
Make sure you have something clicked in.

25:53.674 --> 26:08.738
All right, 10 seconds here.

26:08.758 --> 26:16.760
I'll close this down in three, two, one.

26:21.565 --> 26:23.346
All right, so I'm gonna show this.

26:29.608 --> 26:30.349
We did pretty good.

26:31.189 --> 26:31.729
I'll take that.

26:31.809 --> 26:40.333
I know some of you were like, oh, 86%, if there was an 86% average on the exam, oh man, I'd throw everyone a party in here.

26:40.453 --> 26:41.993
Like, I'd take that all day long.

26:42.394 --> 26:47.296
So don't worry, 86, yeah, that's not 100, but I'm okay with that.

26:47.436 --> 26:48.096
That's pretty good.

26:48.596 --> 26:49.877
Let's talk about this really quick.

26:50.736 --> 26:56.820
Right, if I increase exercise intensity, what are we trying to utilize more of?

26:58.140 --> 27:00.101
Carbs, yep, just like what we talked about.

27:00.602 --> 27:05.805
On the RER chart, if I'm at 100% carbohydrate, what's that RER value?

27:06.785 --> 27:08.226
One, and then if I'm at 100% fat, what are we at?

27:11.020 --> 27:11.580
0.7, good.

27:11.880 --> 27:23.006
So if we look at this chart over here, and if I'm moving from 0% carbohydrate to 100, we're getting closer to ones who are increasing the RER.

27:26.327 --> 27:39.313
Okay, so as carbohydrates are increasing with exercise intensity and fats are kind of decreasing, well eventually you're gonna have these two lines kind of cross, which you can kind of imply from this table right here.

27:41.873 --> 27:46.435
Where these two lines cross is called the crossover concept.

27:47.636 --> 27:59.382
So this, pretty much this crossover point is the point at which our body switches over from primarily fat oxidation to primarily carbohydrate oxidation.

28:03.043 --> 28:06.085
As soon as we kind of move over from here,

28:08.111 --> 28:12.815
Then again, we can kind of tell in individuals maybe at a certain intensity point.

28:15.717 --> 28:22.163
So the next question you might ask yourself, what's causing this crossover concept or this crossover to occur?

28:23.664 --> 28:24.845
Well, there are a few things.

28:25.646 --> 28:27.107
We're gonna go over two of them.

28:27.527 --> 28:32.672
One would be the recruitment of fast muscle fibers that are better equipped to metabolize carbohydrates than fats.

28:39.124 --> 28:48.714
No.

28:48.874 --> 28:50.255
We're gonna get into that in a second.

28:50.335 --> 28:51.917
Yeah, can we hold on to that thought?

28:52.057 --> 28:52.818
Okay, cool, cool.

28:54.810 --> 28:58.092
OK, so recruitment of different muscle fibers.

28:58.392 --> 28:59.313
And we'll get into this.

28:59.353 --> 29:07.538
But if you remember from anatomy, you're kind of shifting from that type 1 to type 2 fiber recruitment as you are increasing exercise intensity.

29:07.978 --> 29:11.120
And so we start to rely more on carbohydrates for that.

29:12.334 --> 29:16.695
You also have increasing blood levels of epinephrine to stimulate glycogenolysis.

29:16.875 --> 29:26.818
So very similar to what we saw with exercise duration, epinephrine and norepinephrine also increase with intensity.

29:28.839 --> 29:34.260
So epinephrine and norepinephrine both increase with intensity and duration.

29:35.880 --> 29:40.682
The magnitude is a little bit different, but don't worry about which one's more or which one's less.

29:41.562 --> 29:42.622
They just both increase, yeah.

29:55.444 --> 29:58.625
Yeah, yeah, so you're bringing up a really great question.

29:58.705 --> 30:04.786
So if we have an increase in epinephrine, we just talked about how that's going to help with breakdown of triglycerides.

30:05.426 --> 30:06.466
Hang on to that thought.

30:06.486 --> 30:07.967
We're going to touch into that.

30:08.127 --> 30:09.147
Well, I guess we can.

30:12.276 --> 30:15.959
Where do we store most of our adipose tissue?

30:18.761 --> 30:21.883
You don't have to say like exact location, but in the muscle or not in the muscle?

30:22.564 --> 30:23.284
Not in the muscle.

30:23.945 --> 30:28.148
When you are increasing exercise intensity, where do you want to send most of the blood?

30:29.622 --> 30:49.875
to the muscle and so as you increase in exercise intensity, you start to divert a lot of the blood to the muscle and so that's less blood flow to going to the liver or some of the adipose tissue and so it actually reduces or blunts some of the ability for you to sequester some of the triglycerides or free fatty acids from the triglycerides.

30:50.416 --> 30:53.758
But we'll touch on a few other mechanisms that are kind of impairing with that later.

30:57.033 --> 31:02.075
OK, so influence on exercise intensity on muscle fuel source.

31:02.135 --> 31:07.797
This is very similar to the figure we saw with the four kind of lines going out on that grid.

31:08.617 --> 31:11.639
Here we have exercise intensity 25, 65, and 85, the percent of fuel source used.

31:15.720 --> 31:23.284
We can see that plasma-free fatty acids are the primary energy source at these lower exercise intensities, like 25%.

31:24.945 --> 31:29.607
But as we increase in that exercise intensity, they start to get lower and lower and lower.

31:30.448 --> 31:35.290
And what we start to rely more and more on would be the muscle glycogen, which is this top blue bar.

31:35.631 --> 31:41.714
So as we increase in exercise intensity, we're increasing the utilization from glycogen.

31:47.975 --> 32:01.441
Just like fat oxidation as you increase the duration with training, you can shift the crossover concept as well with exercise intensity.

32:03.141 --> 32:09.084
So for this, if we have this fat oxidation here in this dark line,

32:09.939 --> 32:15.260
And then this dotted line over here, we have the carbohydrate utilization.

32:16.281 --> 32:19.841
With training, you shift the crossover point to the right.

32:22.822 --> 32:30.624
So it doesn't have it necessarily here, but if you go back to the other figure, the crossover point was around 30% to 40%.

32:31.944 --> 32:35.005
And then with training, you push it kind of to the right.

32:37.956 --> 32:47.443
And if I'm just looking at the estimated kind of R over here, no surprise, the R kind of shifts down and to the right.

32:52.521 --> 33:07.664
I like this curve a little bit better because you can draw one crossover concept, then draw an arrow to the right, maybe draw another crossover to that, and then you can see, well, how many carbohydrates or fat am I using at 60%?

33:08.624 --> 33:16.126
Well, this is around 40% over here, but if the old crossover was down here, then it would be closer to 20%.

33:20.825 --> 33:31.268
So the whole name of the game, then, would be both scenarios you're trying to oxidize or use more fat at higher intensities so that you can spare those glycogen molecules.

33:40.430 --> 33:50.233
Interestingly, regardless if you are trained or untrained, this crossover concept occurs really close to something called the lactate threshold.

33:51.568 --> 33:53.189
So that'll be our next concept here.

33:55.091 --> 33:59.935
Before I move on to this, are we okay with exercise intensity and substrate utilization?

34:02.337 --> 34:09.323
Anytime you see a problem that deals with substrate utilization, you need to almost like box off two concepts, duration and intensity.

34:10.525 --> 34:17.551
Once you have those two concepts kind of written or kind of straightened out, then you can try to answer the question.

34:18.548 --> 34:30.195
Because if you mix the two together and you try to apply, like you say, oh, as I increase with exercise duration, now I'm getting carbohydrate utilization to go up, well, that would be a problem.

34:30.255 --> 34:34.958
So just make sure you separate the two and then you look at them a little bit more separate.

34:36.238 --> 34:45.584
Yes, they kind of happen at the same time, but at least for this course, we're really gonna assess you on whether you can identify duration versus intensity.

34:49.497 --> 34:50.497
Okay, lactate threshold.

34:52.418 --> 35:07.220
Just to kind of bring you back over here, if we're in this space where we're looking at glycolysis and we're producing a little bit of pyruvate, that pyruvate kind of bounces into lactate dehydrogenase and then we get lactate.

35:10.541 --> 35:11.661
I like to start with this.

35:12.541 --> 35:15.622
You will not need to know these different terms.

35:16.564 --> 35:22.487
but there are a lot of terms out there when trying to describe this concept.

35:24.048 --> 35:32.572
Anaerobic threshold, onset of blood lactate accumulation, onset of plasma lactate accumulation, maximal steady state, critical power, lactate break point.

35:33.213 --> 35:35.734
There are a ton of researchers that use different terms.

35:36.534 --> 35:43.098
The reason why I like to put this up here is because depending on the paper or the book that you read, you could see one of these things.

35:44.138 --> 35:51.821
They all generally are referring to the same concept, but sometimes they kind of put them on different spectrums as far as intensity.

35:52.521 --> 35:58.524
So there's another one on here that's like one millimolar above lactate break point, things like that.

35:59.404 --> 36:02.385
So this is just more for your information.

36:02.425 --> 36:04.586
Don't worry, you'll never be tested on this.

36:05.026 --> 36:11.709
Just know that people set the lactate threshold at different lactate concentrations or powers.

36:14.280 --> 36:15.401
Okay, so lactate threshold.

36:15.441 --> 36:21.006
This is the work rate at which blood lactate rises systematically during a graded exercise test.

36:21.667 --> 36:39.884
What that means is if I have an exercise intensity down on the x-axis, whether that's in relative or absolute, so speed versus percent VO2 max, and then on the y we have lactate concentration, as I increase the intensity,

36:42.188 --> 36:49.792
your blood lactate actually does not change as the workloads are getting harder to a certain point.

36:51.813 --> 36:56.055
Then at that point, you start to get a systematic rise in blood lactate.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.157
So that's this inflection point here.

37:04.279 --> 37:09.042
Typically, we see this around 50 to 60% VO2 max in untrained individuals.

37:10.335 --> 37:12.736
and then we see it a little bit higher in trained subjects.

37:14.176 --> 37:28.822
This is the average range here, but we have sampled lactate or lactate levels or lactate threshold in the United States Olympic development team, like the runners, and some of them are in the low 90s, like 92%.

37:31.770 --> 37:37.035
And so what they are trying to do is they're trying to push this threshold as far to the right as possible.

37:37.776 --> 37:42.320
So this blue line would be trained individuals and the red line would be the untrained individuals.

37:43.301 --> 37:54.251
So they're trying to push this as far to the right as possible so they can maintain this flat lactate concentration for higher intensities.

37:59.465 --> 38:13.731
Okay, so hopefully you're okay with this concept and the next question in the back of your mind might be like, okay, well, this is nice to see that we have this flat piece, but what's actually causing the increase in this lactate concentration?

38:15.692 --> 38:18.593
Here are some potential mechanisms to explain the lactate threshold.

38:20.414 --> 38:22.895
One would be low muscle glycogen.

38:24.336 --> 38:26.517
I'm gonna try to emphasize as best as I can.

38:27.660 --> 38:29.641
This is not well accepted.

38:31.322 --> 38:38.466
There are probably only a few people out there as far as like exercise physiologists that actually believe this is true.

38:39.707 --> 38:47.731
The reason why it's still here on this chart though is because some people still have this idea that it's due to low muscle oxygen.

38:47.751 --> 38:49.532
And we'll get into that in just a little bit.

38:51.740 --> 38:54.022
The next would be accelerated glycolysis.

38:54.583 --> 39:02.649
No surprise if I'm creating more pyruvate while I'm increasing the chances that pyruvate's gonna bump into that enzyme and get converted to lactate.

39:03.430 --> 39:04.510
Seems reasonable to me.

39:05.231 --> 39:10.015
Recruitment of fast-twitch fibers, that also seems reasonable to me.

39:10.815 --> 39:20.083
But that doesn't necessarily tell me whether, all these are telling me is that I'm increasing in the lactate production.

39:22.470 --> 39:28.333
What we need to kind of keep in the back of our mind is, our body actually uptakes lactate.

39:30.193 --> 39:38.317
If we just had these three pieces here, then we wouldn't see this one.

39:40.018 --> 39:47.821
Because at every single one of these intensities here, especially for the train one, glycolysis is increasing at every single one of these points.

39:48.758 --> 39:50.739
And you are recruiting more fast-twitch fibers.

39:51.259 --> 39:52.859
So you are producing more lactate.

39:53.760 --> 39:56.961
But you're still not getting an increase in lactate concentration here.

40:00.242 --> 40:05.664
And so what we need to keep in the back of our mind is that we actually remove lactate from the blood.

40:06.744 --> 40:09.686
And another piece could be a reduced rate of lactate removal.

40:12.106 --> 40:16.268
If you take all of this as kind of in total,

40:18.217 --> 40:21.139
This is the take home message that you should probably look at.

40:22.681 --> 40:34.830
Blood lactate concentration is just this formula of rate of appearance minus the rate of disappearance or the rate of removal.

40:36.412 --> 40:38.393
How much are you putting into the blood?

40:39.234 --> 40:40.955
And then how much are you taking out?

40:42.577 --> 40:45.339
At these lower intensities, you're almost at like zero.

40:47.985 --> 40:53.267
So that's the biggest thing we need to kind of keep in mind of what's causing the lactate threshold.

40:54.908 --> 41:01.291
I don't know specifically if I'm removing less or just producing more.

41:02.912 --> 41:17.458
So if you think of like a bucket of water and I turn on a faucet to fill up the bucket and then I poke a hole in the bottom, well if I match the rate that the bucket is losing water with the faucet, the water level should not change.

41:18.833 --> 41:22.155
But if I turn on the faucet more, yeah, you're gonna get an accumulation of that water.

41:23.196 --> 41:30.601
Or instead of turning on the faucet and just leave the faucet at the same rate, I make the hole a little bit bigger or smaller, that will change the water level.

41:31.401 --> 41:39.086
So I don't know, we don't know as researchers if it's the rate of removal versus the rate of production.

41:42.328 --> 41:45.090
And it does depend on the individual as well as the type of exercise.

41:46.869 --> 41:51.712
All we know is it's this kind of rate of removal versus the rate of appearance.

41:56.636 --> 42:00.218
We don't need to break out into a group, but this is kind of just a fun thing.

42:00.298 --> 42:02.940
How do we actually get this?

42:03.401 --> 42:07.143
How do we measure blood lactate levels over time during graded exercise tests?

42:07.624 --> 42:10.586
Maybe some of you have already done it, but any ideas?

42:13.808 --> 42:13.928
Yeah.

42:15.553 --> 42:16.874
Yeah, you do a little finger stick.

42:17.655 --> 42:21.498
Sometimes you can actually poke the back of the earlobe.

42:22.299 --> 42:23.480
That one's a little bit easier.

42:23.520 --> 42:25.322
And some people are like, oh, I don't know if I like that.

42:25.362 --> 42:31.087
But for cycling, if your hands are on the handlebars, well, it's a little bit easier to access the ear.

42:33.128 --> 42:37.052
For running, typically we have them kind of put their hand out on the treadmill.

42:37.532 --> 42:38.313
We just poke the finger.

42:42.503 --> 42:48.907
The nice thing about this is if I can get someone's lactate threshold, we can do some pretty cool stuff.

42:48.987 --> 42:52.149
We can predict endurance performance pretty well.

42:53.630 --> 43:03.916
We do need to combine this with running economy and some of the better predictions also include things like kinetics, critical power, as well as VO2 max.

43:05.557 --> 43:08.879
The other nice thing would be we can plan some training programs.

43:10.413 --> 43:21.539
If the idea is let's push the lactate threshold to the right as far as possible, well then we need to spend the most amount of our training inside of that lactate threshold range.

43:21.699 --> 43:28.983
So a little bit above, maybe right at it to try to push that curve and stress the body to get it to move to the right.

43:33.857 --> 43:39.600
You'll be working with this formula in lab, so I won't spend too much time with this.

43:40.460 --> 43:55.446
But essentially, your 10K race time does a really good job for your ability to run 10 kilometers is very closely linked to where your lactate threshold occurs as far as pacing.

43:56.547 --> 43:59.048
So we can then predict performance in 10K race.

43:59.108 --> 44:01.069
We need to determine the lactate threshold.

44:02.325 --> 44:03.846
And then we can measure VO2 max.

44:05.147 --> 44:13.735
We input these into a different formula that you won't be responsible for, but we can estimate the 10K running time using this formula here.

44:19.200 --> 44:20.100
So what does that look like?

44:20.421 --> 44:24.543
Okay, well, we'll draw kind of one line over this way on the lactate threshold.

44:24.583 --> 44:33.267
So if you have oxygen uptake or intensity on the X axis and then blood lactate on the Y, we draw one line to establish that baseline lactate.

44:33.807 --> 44:36.869
And then once we see that systematic rise, we'll draw another line.

44:37.309 --> 44:44.553
And wherever those points intersect, we pretty much drop that towards the intensity and we know where their lactate threshold is around.

44:45.930 --> 44:49.493
You will not be taking lactate samples in lab.

44:50.173 --> 44:54.957
We'll instead use something called the ventilatory threshold, which behaves very similarly.

44:56.738 --> 45:01.902
It's not a direct measure of lactate threshold, but it gives us a good idea of where lactate threshold might be around.

45:03.843 --> 45:05.585
And then you can plug in these values here.

45:06.105 --> 45:11.909
And then for this particular individual, we are predicting them to finish the 10K time in about 48.78 minutes.

45:19.140 --> 45:20.122
Any questions on this?

45:24.329 --> 45:25.290
All right, nice.

45:27.394 --> 45:32.302
So then we get into this next concept about lactate.

45:33.709 --> 45:34.269
and fatigue.

45:34.910 --> 45:44.854
How many of you have heard that lactate is either some sort of contributor or influencing an individual's to fatigue?

45:44.894 --> 45:48.435
So lactate causes fatigue, lactate causes soreness or discomfort, right?

45:48.455 --> 45:50.616
We've all probably heard that term before.

45:52.137 --> 45:56.299
So then, what could we do then to test this?

45:59.397 --> 46:03.360
What's like the most extreme example as to how we could test this?

46:05.622 --> 46:13.709
Yeah, you could inject lactate, but then you wouldn't know though that maybe still the lower concentrations are still contributing.

46:14.809 --> 46:21.415
What's the extreme way, we can't really do this, but what's the extreme way on the reverse side of that?

46:28.884 --> 46:33.665
Yeah, so what if we just eliminated lactate production altogether?

46:33.685 --> 46:36.546
Well, that seems pretty nice, right?

46:36.586 --> 46:50.569
Because if I eliminate lactate production at all from exercise, then they shouldn't have any type of fatigue, and they shouldn't have the muscle soreness or the burning, right?

46:50.889 --> 46:52.850
That seems reasonable, but we can't do that.

46:53.896 --> 46:54.456
Or can we?

46:54.976 --> 46:55.496
No, we can't.

46:55.796 --> 46:58.697
But there is something called McArdle's disease.

46:59.717 --> 47:03.738
So McArdle's disease is a very interesting genetic mutation.

47:04.658 --> 47:19.021
So there's an error in the muscle glycogen where these individuals cannot synthesize the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, which means they cannot break down glycogen and glycolysis does not occur.

47:20.802 --> 47:20.942
Whoa.

47:22.292 --> 47:29.035
That's a tough deal for them, but this gave researchers a pretty interesting idea.

47:29.755 --> 47:36.938
What if we check these lactate levels and see what happens during exercise?

47:37.579 --> 47:44.422
So here on this top curve, we have blood lactate, and then we have percent of relative VO2 max.

47:45.702 --> 47:52.343
The dark or the solid lines are McArdle's patients and the dotted lines are controls, normal healthy controls.

47:54.504 --> 48:04.906
As we increase exercise intensity all the way to 100, no surprise that the levels of lactate do not change in these McArdle's patients.

48:05.846 --> 48:08.387
But the controls do have a lactate threshold.

48:10.787 --> 48:13.188
Nice, at least the experimental model worked.

48:14.150 --> 48:22.075
We're seeing no change in lactate in these Mercadil's patients, but we're seeing an exponential increase in lactate concentration in the controls.

48:23.436 --> 48:25.777
Well, maybe something else was going on with ventilation.

48:25.897 --> 48:28.459
No, they're still having an increase in ventilation.

48:28.559 --> 48:30.920
So there's an excess buildup of hydrogen ions.

48:31.200 --> 48:35.603
They're undergoing the bicarb buffering system, and they're having some hyperventilation.

48:37.724 --> 48:41.447
And they also see the same in controls.

48:44.623 --> 48:53.071
But, McCardell's patients, they do not tolerate exercise very well.

48:54.091 --> 49:07.924
There's a big issue with these individuals or these patients that the main complaint during any type of exercise activity is the soreness, the burning, and the fatigue.

49:10.215 --> 49:21.749
So it's quite interesting that they are experiencing the same issues that we experience albeit at a lower intensity with no lactate.

49:23.534 --> 49:27.677
There's also those pieces where we talked about, I think someone had mentioned infusing lactate.

49:27.977 --> 49:32.600
Well, if I infuse lactate at a higher concentration, it's not like our whole body starts to burn.

49:33.060 --> 49:38.824
And then someone can argue, well, maybe it's because there's a higher lactate concentration inside of the muscle compared to the blood.

49:38.844 --> 49:41.305
And that's true, but then you still can't get past this.

49:48.249 --> 49:52.132
So then if they can't break down carbohydrate sources, what are they using?

49:54.553 --> 49:56.434
to do the exercise or any type of activity.

49:58.495 --> 49:59.616
There's only one other option.

50:00.216 --> 50:00.956
Fats, right?

50:00.976 --> 50:07.159
So not surprisingly, McArdle's patients use more fat as a fuel compared to control subjects during submaximal exercise.

50:08.060 --> 50:10.041
However, this is pretty interesting.

50:11.121 --> 50:17.644
Despite the rising levels of fatty acids in the blood, McArdle's patients are not able to oxidize more fat.

50:18.825 --> 50:19.065
What?

50:19.085 --> 50:20.566
What's going on?

50:21.621 --> 50:24.904
These poor micartos patients, they're just struggling the whole way through.

50:26.625 --> 50:36.333
This introduced this idea of how fats need to burn in the flame of a carbohydrate.

50:37.254 --> 50:42.799
So carbohydrate availability limits fat oxidation even during steady state exercise in these patients.

50:43.459 --> 50:47.182
The idea is that if you reduce

50:48.433 --> 50:51.914
some of the important substrates of the Krebs cycle.

50:52.094 --> 51:00.158
So maybe you're not just producing some of the four carbons in a higher quantity when you're burning carbohydrates as opposed to only fats.

51:00.538 --> 51:06.340
And you start limiting the ability to produce or run through the Krebs cycle.

51:07.889 --> 51:13.511
And so this idea that fats must burn in the flame of carbohydrates came from these researchers.

51:14.331 --> 51:21.273
So glycogen is depleted during prolonged high-intensity exercise, and so we're reducing the rate of glycolysis and production of pyruvate.

51:21.753 --> 51:24.994
You're also reducing a lot of the Krebs cycle intermediaries.

51:25.635 --> 51:31.336
So alpha-ketoglutaric acid might be in high demand, but low availability.

51:32.037 --> 51:36.538
And that overall, this idea is you're reducing fat oxidation.

51:42.445 --> 51:54.393
This isn't like, there's still a lot of research that needs to go on in this area to really confirm whether this is happening, but the theory seems reasonable.

51:57.935 --> 51:58.656
Any questions here?

52:00.577 --> 52:00.877
Okay.

52:03.259 --> 52:05.080
So then that gets us into another one, right?

52:05.120 --> 52:07.742
We're gonna tackle a few things all today.

52:09.183 --> 52:10.064
Lactate threshold.

52:11.137 --> 52:13.158
We're having trouble burning fat.

52:15.378 --> 52:18.639
We're going to talk about this concept called the fat burning zone.

52:21.820 --> 52:23.320
There's no right or wrong answer.

52:23.340 --> 52:24.521
Well, there is a right or wrong answer.

52:24.561 --> 52:31.283
But just answer maybe what you previously thought or what you currently believe now.

52:33.272 --> 52:34.574
This is a low stakes question.

52:34.774 --> 52:40.502
As you increase exercise intensity, you shift from primarily burning fats to burning carbohydrates.

52:41.102 --> 52:44.867
Therefore, to lose the most weight, you should exercise at low intensities.

52:45.608 --> 52:46.469
True or false?

52:47.190 --> 52:50.455
Feel free to discuss with your classmates and we'll take like a minute.

53:56.716 --> 53:58.737
Okay, let's go maybe 30 more seconds.

53:58.817 --> 54:00.117
Double check you have an answer in.

54:00.558 --> 54:02.498
We're missing I think like 15 clickers here.

54:02.518 --> 54:09.581
There we go, five more.

54:09.601 --> 54:24.227
Okay, I'll close this down in three, two, one.

54:29.842 --> 54:40.187
Okay, I like showing this poll here because it used to be like maybe 70, 30 on this end.

54:40.827 --> 54:45.149
So maybe this isn't as much of a myth as once thought.

54:45.529 --> 54:46.569
But can I get some ideas?

54:47.230 --> 54:48.130
So what are we thinking here?

54:48.830 --> 54:51.271
So it's a safe space, it's okay if you put yes or no.

54:52.172 --> 54:52.912
Tell me what you're thinking.

55:05.129 --> 55:09.376
Yeah, yeah, and where did that come from, I guess, because of this top concept?

55:11.139 --> 55:12.181
Yeah, no, I would agree.

55:13.583 --> 55:16.589
Any counter arguments to that?

55:17.808 --> 55:37.660
if you're trying to use cardio to lose weight, even though the percentages of carbs to fat or calories being burned might be or fats to carbs might be higher at lower intensities, you're going to end up burning more calories regardless at a higher intensity.

55:37.700 --> 55:40.582
So you might as well just do higher intensity.

55:41.392 --> 55:43.254
Yeah, yeah, no, I like that thought too.

55:43.314 --> 55:55.506
So it's basically, even though you're getting a larger contribution from fats at a lower intensity, so a higher percent, if you exercise at a higher intensity, you're getting an increase in total energy expenditure.

55:55.746 --> 55:56.867
So I really like that one.

55:57.788 --> 56:01.372
But the true piece, you're not alone.

56:03.424 --> 56:07.466
How many, this is even in your textbook, how many of you have seen this before?

56:08.106 --> 56:18.511
If you want to lose weight, in particular, burn fat, fat burning, you need to stay in the light to very light zone.

56:19.551 --> 56:30.456
We need to be in the low intensity to maximize the fat oxidation or the fat burning, which brought us into this fat burning zone myth.

56:31.456 --> 56:32.337
Where did they get this?

56:33.934 --> 56:36.376
from probably what most of you are thinking right here.

56:36.956 --> 56:50.928
If I look at this teal curve, if I wanna burn the most fat as far as a percent here, just looking at this curve, if someone showed me this curve, I would say I need to be at the lowest intensity to burn the most fat.

56:53.850 --> 57:02.337
But that's not necessarily what ends up happening because if I am walking around campus for an hour,

57:04.343 --> 57:05.563
and I burn 100 calories.

57:08.124 --> 57:15.065
Maybe 99% of the calories of the 100 are coming from fat, right?

57:15.185 --> 57:19.646
That seems great, but what if I ran or jogged around campus for an hour?

57:21.126 --> 57:33.048
Well, now I'm burning maybe 600 calories, and even though I'm only taking 50%, well, that 50% is from a larger piece of a pie, so now I'm burning 300 calories from fat.

57:34.040 --> 57:44.963
And so we'll get into this here, where at low intensities, say 20% VO2 max, maybe the total energy expenditure is three kcals per minute.

57:46.544 --> 57:53.446
If the R or the RER is 0.8, 67% of the energy is coming from fat.

57:54.346 --> 58:01.408
So a higher fat oxidation compared to a carbohydrate oxidation.

58:02.605 --> 58:09.509
Let's take some time, not too long, but let's calculate how many kcals are gonna come from fat here.

58:09.729 --> 58:10.830
It shouldn't take you too long.

58:11.551 --> 58:14.272
And then calculate how many kcals are coming from carbohydrates.

58:15.313 --> 58:16.454
So let's spend a couple minutes.

58:16.974 --> 58:21.857
It'll be a relatively straightforward calculation here, but let's just do that really fast.

59:40.075 --> 59:41.298
Okay, how are we doing with this one?

59:41.819 --> 59:42.160
Pretty good?

59:42.180 --> 59:47.311
You're just pretty much doing 67% of the total, right?

59:48.614 --> 59:48.995
And then, okay.

59:51.428 --> 59:52.829
So we're at 20% VO2 max.

59:52.849 --> 59:56.490
We'll go over these calculations in a bit, but we're gonna try one more.

59:56.510 --> 59:58.491
20% VO2 max, three kcal per minute.

59:58.991 --> 01:00:06.974
If I bump us up to 60% VO2 max, nine kcal per minute, and we get an R of .9, 33% energy from fat.

01:00:07.014 --> 01:00:11.876
Let's calculate how many kcal per minute are coming from fat and carbohydrates.

01:00:12.356 --> 01:00:14.017
And these are real numbers here, right?

01:00:14.797 --> 01:00:17.058
You will all see these numbers yourselves

01:00:18.642 --> 01:00:21.880
Well, not all of you, but whoever's volunteering to exercise next week.

01:01:01.412 --> 01:01:03.854
OK, don't worry if you're not there yet.

01:01:04.114 --> 01:01:14.240
But on that first one, was it like 67% of your carb, 67% of the energy that you just expended are coming from fats.

01:01:14.841 --> 01:01:16.682
Around how many kcal per minute would that be?

01:01:18.902 --> 01:01:19.182
Say again?

01:01:19.883 --> 01:01:20.683
Close to two, right?

01:01:21.223 --> 01:01:21.464
Yeah.

01:01:21.764 --> 01:01:31.970
So if you just took this, I know it's not exactly, but yeah, around 67 times 3, we're getting 2 kcals per minute from fat and 1 kcal per minute from carbohydrates.

01:01:32.650 --> 01:01:43.097
No one's going to argue that this lower intensity had a higher fat oxidation rate from a relative standpoint, the percentage.

01:01:45.166 --> 01:01:52.888
And then same deal, no one's gonna argue that as you increase exercise intensity, you're gonna have a decrease in the relative contribution from fat.

01:01:53.868 --> 01:01:58.430
But look at that, three Kcal per minute from fat versus two.

01:02:01.971 --> 01:02:03.471
Web of lies, right?

01:02:03.711 --> 01:02:05.852
We've just been fed all these lies, they're all lies.

01:02:06.132 --> 01:02:07.092
Just kidding, no, it's okay.

01:02:07.792 --> 01:02:08.832
Why is this happening?

01:02:09.833 --> 01:02:14.214
Well, if you were to actually plot this at every single exercise intensity,

01:02:15.366 --> 01:02:19.675
we actually get into something called the maximum fat oxidation rate.

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:25.115
There are a lot of athletes that we build these curves for.

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:30.980
This is something that athletes do like, and sometimes people who are undergoing any type of exercise training program.

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:48.435
We can actually look and see if this here, this on the left y-axis is R, or RER, on the right is the absolute, so grams per minute fat oxidation here on the right y-axis.

01:02:50.179 --> 01:02:52.701
And then on the bottom here we have exercise intensity.

01:02:54.242 --> 01:03:14.237
As we increase in exercise intensity, the absolute fat oxidation rate increases up to a certain point where the exercise intensity starts to have such a small contribution from fat that we actually start to decrease in this fat oxidation rate.

01:03:16.779 --> 01:03:17.459
So I guess the,

01:03:18.822 --> 01:03:30.912
Moral of the story with this one is, well, there are some exercise intensities that are too high to have a high absolute fat oxidation rate, and some of them are too low.

01:03:33.014 --> 01:03:44.543
We need to kind of build this curve to find where that maximum fat oxidation rate is to try to capture in how much, or if someone is really trying to burn the most amount of fat.

01:03:49.012 --> 01:03:50.973
So this is pretty good, right?

01:03:51.053 --> 01:03:53.914
OK, I need to be maybe around 60%.

01:03:56.836 --> 01:04:01.598
Interestingly enough, that also occurs very close to one's lactate threshold.

01:04:03.238 --> 01:04:12.843
So at 60% intensity, you are actually burning the most fat compared to any other intensity in this given example here.

01:04:15.804 --> 01:04:16.984
All right, so maybe you're thinking, man,

01:04:19.799 --> 01:04:30.423
Are we really towing the line here between maximum fat oxidation from here to here because we're looking at point three versus point four?

01:04:31.643 --> 01:04:36.505
Well, yeah, that could add up over multiple sessions as you are exercising.

01:04:37.946 --> 01:04:39.046
Here's the other part.

01:04:39.806 --> 01:04:40.727
This is the nice part.

01:04:42.347 --> 01:04:46.589
Not only do you burn more fat during exercise,

01:04:47.828 --> 01:04:51.009
that you actually burn more after exercise.

01:04:53.170 --> 01:05:03.214
So this is the post-exercise resting metabolic rate, RMR, and how it becomes elevated after higher intensity exercise.

01:05:04.014 --> 01:05:07.095
So we're looking at 80 minutes of high intensity cycling.

01:05:09.256 --> 01:05:12.957
If I'm looking at different exercise intensity down here, so 30%, 50%, and 75%,

01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:24.238
And we're looking at, on the right side here, caloric expenditure post exercise.

01:05:25.799 --> 01:05:28.121
So don't worry too much about this black curve.

01:05:28.201 --> 01:05:30.483
This is just telling us how long it was elevated.

01:05:31.024 --> 01:05:34.607
Well, I guess that is pretty nice because that's 10 hours after exercise.

01:05:34.667 --> 01:05:43.015
But after all of that, just during rest, so they undergo 80 minutes of high intensity exercise,

01:05:44.248 --> 01:05:48.991
and then you take them off the bike and you lay them and have them quietly rest or sleep.

01:05:50.151 --> 01:06:01.117
You measure the caloric expenditure during rest and they are burning 151 calories after exercise compared to 7 and 29 at 30 and 50%.

01:06:03.919 --> 01:06:10.242
When I am resting, what percent would you say I would be utilizing from fat?

01:06:12.483 --> 01:06:15.444
around, we don't need an exact number, but 100.

01:06:15.564 --> 01:06:18.466
I'd say like 99.9, but yeah, 100, right?

01:06:18.486 --> 01:06:24.168
150 of those 151 calories are coming from fat.

01:06:25.088 --> 01:06:31.051
So not only did you burn more during exercise, but you start burning more after exercise.

01:06:33.512 --> 01:06:34.612
Whoa, right?

01:06:34.632 --> 01:06:35.433
That's pretty cool.

01:06:36.953 --> 01:06:37.954
So why is this happening?

01:06:40.705 --> 01:06:46.648
Well there's something that we need to look at which is the kind of epoch exercise post-oxygen consumption.

01:06:49.129 --> 01:06:55.373
Oxygen uptake remains elevated above rest while we are recovering from exercise.

01:06:56.994 --> 01:07:02.957
That again is called excess post-exercise oxygen consumption

01:07:07.402 --> 01:07:17.986
So previously termed as oxygen depth, sometimes you'll hear this term, but we don't really use that term for epoch anymore because we put it at the start of exercise basically.

01:07:19.207 --> 01:07:23.369
This means the O2 consumed is greater than the O2 demand.

01:07:24.509 --> 01:07:28.191
We have two separate portions that we're gonna talk about here in the next slide.

01:07:28.971 --> 01:07:30.872
It's the rapid portion and the slow portion, yep.

01:07:38.782 --> 01:07:39.262
This one right here?

01:07:39.863 --> 01:07:43.866
Okay.

01:07:45.407 --> 01:07:49.089
Yeah, but if I, so that's a good question.

01:07:49.269 --> 01:08:01.178
If I then push this to 90%, you are correct that things start to linger a bit more, but it becomes a little bit more problematic because you might not be able to sustain that exercise for 80 minutes.

01:08:02.893 --> 01:08:10.274
So as I increase in exercise intensity by default, if I told you to sprint as fast as you can, well, that's probably going to be like 15 seconds.

01:08:10.935 --> 01:08:13.695
And so you're not going to see this as large of an increase.

01:08:14.155 --> 01:08:16.496
And that's why that fat oxidation starts to curl down.

01:08:17.276 --> 01:08:25.537
So if you stay on that max fat oxidation intensity and you maintain that, you'll get kind of the dual benefit during exercise and post exercise.

01:08:25.557 --> 01:08:26.898
So that would be a combination of the two.

01:08:27.098 --> 01:08:28.558
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah.

01:08:32.937 --> 01:08:35.359
Okay, so these are the two parts, right?

01:08:35.419 --> 01:08:39.542
If we're looking at moderate exercise, so kind of the lower intensity exercise.

01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:53.253
We talked about this already, where if you jump on a treadmill and start exercising, you don't automatically have a heart rate, ventilation, and oxygen consumption that matches the energy demand.

01:08:54.074 --> 01:08:57.517
It takes a little bit of time for us to reach steady state.

01:08:59.659 --> 01:09:02.241
Anything that's shaded on the left of this

01:09:03.575 --> 01:09:06.776
Well, we had to use what kind of sources to keep us on the treadmill?

01:09:11.178 --> 01:09:14.539
Yeah, anaerobic or non-oxidative or those immediate energy sources.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.341
We had to rely on those to keep us running.

01:09:19.001 --> 01:09:21.242
And that's why that's deemed like O2 debt.

01:09:21.802 --> 01:09:22.843
We didn't use oxygen.

01:09:23.303 --> 01:09:25.744
The demand was much higher than what we actually utilized.

01:09:26.824 --> 01:09:28.825
Okay, and then we stop exercise at six minutes.

01:09:29.995 --> 01:09:32.116
And you all have probably experienced this before.

01:09:32.376 --> 01:09:37.618
Maybe you're running after the bus or you're running late to class or you're just kind of exercising and then you sit down.

01:09:38.298 --> 01:09:41.940
Well, you don't sit down and automatically your heart rate drops and your ventilation drops.

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:44.821
No, it takes a little bit for you to settle down.

01:09:46.521 --> 01:09:48.162
That's what this piece is here.

01:09:48.222 --> 01:09:55.685
If I shade this in, you are not doing any work, but you are still consuming oxygen here.

01:09:56.772 --> 01:10:00.573
This initial slope here is the rapid component.

01:10:01.693 --> 01:10:06.275
And then once the slope starts to flatten out, that's the slow component.

01:10:09.996 --> 01:10:21.399
If then I bump you up to a harder exercise intensity, you will see a larger O2 debt and a larger epoch.

01:10:25.445 --> 01:10:30.389
Here we are almost saying they have reached VO2 max.

01:10:32.911 --> 01:10:44.200
In order for this individual to sustain the exercise from oxidative phosphorylation, they would need to consume 4.5 liters per minute.

01:10:45.601 --> 01:10:49.485
For whatever reason, they are unable to do that.

01:10:50.626 --> 01:10:52.707
And so the maximum oxygen consumption is 3.5.

01:10:54.933 --> 01:10:59.515
That means they are an O2 deficit all the way up to this 4.5 spot.

01:11:02.896 --> 01:11:09.038
Once you stop exercise, you can see the dramatic change in epoch.

01:11:10.239 --> 01:11:16.041
So this one kind of flattened out almost to baseline after, what is that, four minutes after exercise?

01:11:16.961 --> 01:11:17.822
Whereas this one,

01:11:19.102 --> 01:11:27.247
we're kind of delaying this all the way out to almost 14 minutes and it didn't even flatten off and this actually extends for quite a long time.

01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:41.215
And so you can see the rapid component and the slow component are much longer compared to moderate exercise.

01:11:46.023 --> 01:11:54.971
Though it's not the only contributing factor, a larger O2 debt will result in a larger epoch.

01:11:57.033 --> 01:12:09.765
So if I draw a larger area under the curve over here or under this line, then that will be, so larger O2 debt, larger epoch.

01:12:10.105 --> 01:12:11.487
So if I'm just shading this in,

01:12:13.132 --> 01:12:19.796
If you actually take this area, you take the integral of this and the integral of that, they actually don't equal one to one.

01:12:19.816 --> 01:12:20.176
So it's not 100%.

01:12:22.118 --> 01:12:25.600
But if I see a large O2 debt, I know there's going to be a large epoch.

01:12:30.002 --> 01:12:31.623
So then what are all the factors?

01:12:31.984 --> 01:12:34.185
Well, here are the factors contributing to epoch.

01:12:36.338 --> 01:12:50.648
This one over here, restoration of muscle and blood oxygen stores and the resynthesis of phosphocreatine are gonna contribute to the rapid portion of EPOC, whereas the conversion of lactate to glucose as well as all of these others are gonna contribute to the slow component.

01:12:59.194 --> 01:12:59.995
Any questions here?

01:13:04.317 --> 01:13:04.618
All right.

01:13:04.638 --> 01:13:06.763
Well, that's all I have for you.

01:13:06.863 --> 01:13:07.825
Enjoy your weekend.

01:13:08.707 --> 01:13:09.209
Have a good one.
