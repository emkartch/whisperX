1
00:00:03,997 --> 00:00:07,523
The outer, visible portion of our ear faces forward and

2
00:00:07,523 --> 00:00:10,287
has a specialized structure to help us determine the direction

3
00:00:10,287 --> 00:00:14,254
of sounds, as well as emphasize the frequencies in the range of human speech.

4
00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:18,581
Now that the sound waves are caught, they travel through

5
00:00:18,581 --> 00:00:24,753
the ear canal and strike the eardrum, a small membrane about 10 millimeters across.

6
00:00:24,753 --> 00:00:28,940
Now that we receive the sound, the middle ear transfers the sound.

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:34,008
The smallest bones in your body, the malleus, incus, and stapes, start in motion.

8
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:40,699
The malleus is attached to the eardrum, and as the

9
00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:44,004
sound travels along, the force is amplified by leverage until it

10
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:48,972
arrives at the stapes, which acts like a piston creating waves through the fluid of the inner ear.

11
00:00:50,538 --> 00:00:55,144
The most significant increase in force comes from a system of hydraulic amplification.

12
00:00:56,146 --> 00:00:58,669
The face of the stapes has a surface area of

13
00:00:58,669 --> 00:01:04,517
3.2 square millimeters, while the eardrum has a surface area of 55 square millimeters.

14
00:01:05,678 --> 00:01:09,363
Using this, along with leverage through the malleus and incus,

15
00:01:09,363 --> 00:01:14,821
causes the final force to be 22 times greater than when the sound first arrived.

16
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:19,726
Now we arrive at the most complicated part of hearing, the cochlea.

17
00:01:19,726 --> 00:01:24,450
In reality, it is coiled up, but it is easier to understand straightened out.

18
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:29,214
The stapes is causing pressure waves to travel through the structure.

19
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:33,658
Along the inside wall is about 20,000 to 30,000 reed-like fibers.

20
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:36,421
As the waves travel along, they encounter fibers with

21
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:40,144
the correct resonant frequency and energy is released.

22
00:01:40,144 --> 00:01:44,048
These fibers aren't actually what give us the signal that we heard something.

23
00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:47,952
There is a special structure next to these fibers containing hair cells.

24
00:01:49,154 --> 00:01:51,736
When the fibers resonate, they cause the hair cells

25
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:57,983
to move, which then sends an electrical impulse to the cochlear nerve and onto the brain.

26
00:01:57,983 --> 00:02:01,888
Certain pitches of sound will resonate in specific locations,

27
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:05,211
and louder sounds will cause more hair cells to move.

28
00:02:05,211 --> 00:02:10,357
Our brain interprets all this raw data, making it possible to enjoy a beautiful song.

29
00:02:10,357 --> 00:02:12,460
or to carry on a conversation.

30
00:02:13,322 --> 00:02:18,210
Just to think that all of this is happening in your head right now, at full speed.

31
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,036
And not just one, but two of these sophisticated instruments

32
00:02:22,036 --> 00:02:24,159
are helping you to have the amazing sense of hearing.

33
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:29,648
This is just one of the many systems in our body that go beyond our humble human understanding.
