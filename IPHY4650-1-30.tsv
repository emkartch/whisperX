227534	228035	All right.
230477	231277	Let's get started.
232599	233379	Good to see you all.
234961	240766	Not sure if we are gonna get a big snowstorm today, but we'll see how that weather goes.
241406	246831	Hopefully you're doing okay and that the second week of labs was good.
248413	250695	It was a little bit of probably
252592	255054	not a wake-up or anything like that, but it was a lot of calculations.
255635	258997	You're gonna have a very similar calculation-based lab next week.
259378	265182	And then after that, the amount of calculations, especially like the Haldane equation, goes way down.
265302	267904	So don't worry, not every lab is gonna be like that.
268485	275871	You should have plenty of time in the future labs to complete the majority, if not all, of the lab and turn it in during that time.
275931	277652	So just hang tight.
277672	281175	We gotta get through these calculations before we move on to the fun stuff.
282477	286001	Second piece, what's in two weeks, two Thursdays from now?
287263	288524	Yeah, your first exam.
288544	294752	So your first lecture exam is in two Thursdays from today, so February 13th.
294912	296914	So please try to keep that in mind.
297615	302100	One of the big things that I like to say right off the bat would be,
303507	306970	I don't know if you're struggling unless you tell me.
307530	315017	And so you want to get some things cleared up now before you find out on the exam if you struggle on the exam.
315597	329229	So I highly recommend if there are any slides or concepts or thought questions or study guide questions that are not making sense that we need to talk about it so we can clear that up.
330970	331711	Are we okay with that?
332573	345599	All right, and that does remind me since we are getting closer to the exams, this is spring semester, I know many of you are trying to graduate, and I know all of you care about your grade, but one thing I like to say is,
347600	353985	So I don't curve the class, because typically, like if it was below a certain amount, like the syllabus says, yeah, we will curve it.
354005	355806	But we don't round grades up.
355866	357067	We don't do anything like that.
357907	369395	But if people are on the edge, some of the things that I do look for are like participation or at least attendance in lecture, as well as participation or attendance in lab.
370095	371336	So I do check those.
371897	373258	And so it's really good.
373318	380304	And I know sometimes it's hard because there are bigger groups this semester, but it's very easy to kind of tuck away and kind of hide in the background.
381245	383627	But I'm going to tell you right now, all your TAs can see that.
383907	387250	So all these small little things do add up.
388010	389171	And if you are on the edge,
390288	397716	Right, we typically don't round, but those do make a big factor in some of those decisions.
398237	399378	So try to keep that in mind.
399778	404023	You're already in lab, you might as well try to learn something and try to enjoy the lab.
404463	405144	Same with lecture.
406085	406766	Are we okay there?
407487	408368	Okay, nice.
409236	413699	All right, so we're gonna try to finish off bioenergetics and exercise metabolism.
414380	435416	Quick review, we learned on Tuesday that exercise duration and fuel selection, if we're just looking at expanding the duration, so the duration of the exercise itself, as the duration increases, we shift from carbohydrate utilization towards fat utilization.
437485	439166	So we ran through some clicker questions.
439226	439947	We looked at that.
440007	441208	Now we want to know why.
443070	447253	So most of this is due to an increased rate of lipolysis.
448013	450676	And lipolysis, again, is the breakdown of triglycerides.
451296	462025	We are mainly not really worried too much about this glycerol, but the pre-fatty acids.
463250	477861	These different lipases are freeing up these free fatty acids from the triglycerides so then we can undergo beta oxidation, get them into acetyl-CoA and then run them through the Krebs cycle and then eventually to the ETC.
479722	490110	The rate of lipolysis increases as we increase the concentration of hormones like epinephrine and norepinephrine.
491626	507736	Here, if we have duration and percent change of the hormone of interest, which is epinephrine or epinephrine, we could see that they substantially increase over time at the same exercise intensity.
508557	513400	So we're not changing the exercise intensity here, just increasing the duration.
521205	522526	So then what does this look like?
522847	524268	Well, it looks something like this.
525249	527451	This is a nice little piece here to add in.
527911	531174	We are looking at submaximal exercise, not maximal exercise.
532395	543225	Anytime we are doing any kind of substrate utilization, it needs to be primarily oxidative phosphorylation, submaximal, constant work rate.
544726	544927	Okay.
546467	551948	This is your substrate utilization in percent, exercise duration over here.
552908	560049	As exercise duration increases, we see a decrease in carbohydrate utilization and an increase in fat utilization.
560769	567431	One of those mechanisms is because we're increasing lipolysis due to the increased secretion of epinephrine.
569911	574992	From a storage standpoint, so number two, second reason, from a storage standpoint,
576862	581303	Which one of these do we have more or less an unlimited source?
584924	585224	Fats.
585604	587024	Yeah, so what about carbohydrates?
588484	588684	No.
589085	590485	What do we store carbohydrates in?
591165	591565	Or as?
592105	592485	What form?
593005	593525	Glycogen.
595206	605388	Another large factor to this decrease in carbohydrate utilization as we increase in exercise duration is we are depleting those glycogen stores.
608597	615099	Glycogen depletion during exercise does depend on intensity, but it also is impacted by time.
616040	624763	Since we are on the duration piece, we'll kind of focus on the duration for now, but just kind of keep in mind that it works at every single intensity.
625603	628645	So here in these little boxes, we have intensity.
628685	633188	So this is 120% of max, 90%, 75, 60, and 30.
633828	639892	And this is glycogen depletion here on the y-axis and then duration or time on the x-axis.
641173	644195	We can see that at every intensity it decreases.
646046	649627	as far as glycogen content with exercise duration.
650347	655868	But we see the largest magnitude in decrease at the 75% intensity.
657268	662029	But I guess the point is, is as you increase in duration, you are depleting those glycogen stores.
666570	671271	If you run out of glycogen or deplete them to a certain level,
672570	679711	you have to rely on other energy stores, which would be this fat utilization over here.
688473	688753	Okay.
690613	696374	So this does not change our model of as exercise intensity increases, we prefer carbohydrates.
697674	700815	It's just we're running out of those carbohydrates with duration.
703235	712820	This is kind of telling the same story, declining the gas drop muscle for glycogen content for three hours of treadmill exercise running at 70% VO2 max.
713360	726247	We see the muscle glycogen decreases, and as we have that decrease in muscle glycogen, it seems like we are working harder, or the perceived exertion here on this y-axis is much higher.
728804	740989	It is interesting though that until about 50 millimoles per kilogram, there wasn't a large or a change in this increase of the rating of perceived exertion.
742530	750033	And I think most of us who have exercised for this long of a duration, maybe one hour to two hour, you may have felt this if you weren't feeding.
751315	757741	So you're exercising, you're feeling pretty good, and then all of a sudden you're like, whoa, I'm in really bad shape here.
757861	758722	I need to feed.
758842	765308	But by that time, you're kind of out of luck, and you have to really decrease that exercise intensity.
765888	771913	Sometimes that's called hitting the wall, or you're bonking, and you really, no matter what, you can try to feed.
771953	775817	But at that point in time, you have to decrease that exercise intensity.
779922	782324	Another kind of figure of the same concept.
782384	782624	Oh, yeah.
785746	786326	Yeah, yeah.
786526	787747	And we'll talk about feeding.
787807	792730	But yeah, as you feed, that really makes a very large difference in this model.
798778	804621	Well, if you are supplying carbohydrates, then you can almost spare some of the glycogen molecules.
805382	807983	You can push this curve a little bit further.
808644	816208	So instead of muscle glycogen ending at four hours, maybe it'll end over here at six, but maybe you're not even exercising for six hours.
816308	818029	So you would never run into that problem.
818810	819410	It's a great question.
820871	830721	So here if we have the two major substrates but broken down in kind of locations, we have muscle triglycerides, plasma-free fatty acids, and then blood glucose and muscle glycogen.
831522	841692	So we can think of this 50% here just like what we saw on that previous figure of fat utilization and carbohydrate utilization right around 50-50, because all of this would be carbohydrate.
842825	857837	They all decrease here, but as we start to deplete our glycogen levels, we are more and more becoming reliant on our glucose levels, which is generally not a great thing because we need to tightly regulate our blood glucose levels.
858477	860519	But they have to pull that energy from somewhere.
862040	868025	No surprise, we're becoming more reliant on the free fatty acids, the plasma free fatty acids.
872033	878216	And so we kind of talked about this a little bit based on your classmates question.
879437	886420	But if muscle glycogen levels are limited during prolonged low intensity exercise, what can an athlete do to delay the fatigue in a race?
888581	891743	We don't have to break off into groups because we just kind of talked about it.
893344	894504	But remind me, what can we do?
894725	895425	There's a few things.
896485	897926	Yeah, you can feed, right?
898626	904730	You can eat and try to maintain some of these blood glucose and glycogen levels.
904770	908932	What else could we do, but if it's an athlete they really don't wanna do it?
911454	912375	Slow down, yeah.
912695	922901	Eventually you can't maintain that exercise intensity, so maybe you have to slow down so you're relying on more fats to produce the energy to sustain that exercise as opposed to carbohydrates.
923681	924642	That's good, good.
927274	933758	OK, I know I'm just almost repeating the same thing over and over, but this is how important these concepts are.
933838	938140	But again, exercise duration on muscle fuel source.
938701	946565	We start to deplete those glycogen levels, so we need to rely more and more on plasma-free fatty acids.
946885	948186	And that's why this one comes way up.
956110	958111	Okay, so are we kinda stuck where we're at?
958571	969436	No, not really, because if we can train or undergo repeated bouts over time of endurance exercise training, we can shift this curve.
970316	982041	And how this curve shifts, if we're just looking at fat oxidation here on the y-axis, so I've kinda taken away carbohydrate to make this a little bit easier to look at, if we start at this bottom curve,
983560	987902	after training, we shift the curve up and to the left.
988402	989863	So up and to the left over here.
990523	992324	So that's what this arrow is indicating.
994545	999607	The nice thing about this would be now I can take any duration
1001450	1003993	draw a line straight up, so say three hours.
1004193	1009700	This was my old line and I was at 48% oxidation.
1010221	1013484	And I come back up to here after training, I'm at 50 or 60, 58, 60% oxidation.
1019611	1024234	So if you're ever like, oh, man, I kind of forgot after training, where does the curve shift?
1024675	1034281	Well, if I drew the curve down below and you just drew a line up, you would see you're burning less fat after training if you drew it incorrectly on the bottom.
1034841	1047150	And so it's pretty straightforward as far as if you have the underlying concept and you draw the curve correctly, or if you have the curve incorrect and you have the underlying concept, you can correct that pretty quickly.
1049170	1057135	So I think draw the curve, draw a line straight up, and you can kind of see which one is improving after training.
1063359	1070223	Any questions on substrate utilization as we are increasing duration or time?
1072465	1072605	Yeah.
1079880	1082262	like the output level of the athletes?
1083544	1091270	So you're saying that as I train, if I'm utilizing more fat, I'm at a disadvantage?
1091491	1092612	Is that kind of what you're getting at?
1094013	1094273	Yeah.
1094353	1099698	So in this instance, one thing, and this is a great question, because we're at the same exercise intensity here.
1100839	1105684	So at the same exercise intensity, we see an increase in fat utilization with training.
1106646	1109787	But that just means with training I can run faster.
1110887	1119990	So then I'd be at a higher absolute speed and I'd be able to maintain the same rate of fat oxidation versus carbohydrate if I push myself on a higher intensity scale.
1121351	1128353	So what this ends up doing is it actually spares your glycogen molecules at a much higher rate for an endurance trained athlete.
1134132	1138876	I guess, like what's the duration of the training like before that?
1138896	1146481	Yeah, it depends a little bit, but most of the studies have six to eight weeks of training and they publish those results.
1147262	1154448	There are individuals who need a little bit less and especially if someone was already endurance trained and then they took a big break and then they went back.
1154868	1157850	We'll talk about how athletes kind of bounce back a little bit faster.
1157910	1163815	But in general, six to eight weeks would be where the majority of the research lands in this kind of area, yeah.
1169745	1173487	Well, so when you say switch, they're always utilizing fat.
1173527	1180470	They're just doing it at a higher percentage after training compared to before training at the same exercise intensity.
1181171	1188534	But if you put them at a higher exercise intensity, well, that changes because on that spectrum, you're still going to have an increase in carbohydrate utilization.
1189755	1190235	Great question.
1190435	1192156	I think there was another one above.
1192476	1193636	And it's OK if you don't have it again?
1194497	1194597	Yep.
1207548	1214195	Yeah, so not necessarily aerobic versus anaerobic, but we would almost say the rate of perceived exertion would be lower.
1214255	1215916	It'd feel a little bit easier.
1216297	1218719	And I think we've all experienced this with some sort of training.
1219079	1220961	You run at five miles per hour every day.
1221562	1227928	Maybe the first day is kind of hard, but then two months later, you're like, oh, five miles per hour is not that bad anymore.
1228168	1229810	And so that kind of happens.
1230791	1240214	The whole time, you're still primarily oxidative, as long as you're getting past a certain duration, which we kind of talked about on Tuesday, where that halfway point is around two to three minutes.
1241054	1244475	After that, you're primarily using oxidative sources.
1245036	1246076	Yeah, that's good.
1250596	1251136	Okay, great.
1251977	1253458	Okay, so this is duration.
1254439	1257121	Now let's look at what happens with intensity.
1258041	1261604	We've kind of already talked about this as we were talking about duration.
1262905	1270971	But for graded exercise, when I say graded exercise, we're talking about an incremental increase in exercise intensity.
1273121	1298102	Just because we are increasing the exercise intensity does not necessarily mean we're talking about anaerobic versus aerobic, but with a lot of these exercise intensities, we are trying to say, well, at least they're exercising for around four to 10 minutes, which is why ATP produced is primarily from aerobic or oxidative metabolism.
1301301	1322090	Once you reach a certain point where you plateau, which is kind of this next slide here, so as I increase the workload here on the X axis, we are increasing our oxygen consumption on the Y. Well, that makes sense because we need more oxygen to then undergo metabolism to produce more ATP, but eventually,
1323658	1334189	We reach a point where even if I increase the workload or the power, there's no increase in oxygen consumption.
1336171	1342698	We'll touch on where the barriers are that are limiting your body's ability to uptake more oxygen.
1344043	1353611	But some of the more easier ones to think about is, well, my lungs are just the size that I have.
1353651	1356093	My heart can't really get that much bigger.
1356253	1358115	Well, they don't get bigger on the outside.
1358695	1361117	You can have some hypertrophy inside of the ventricles.
1361878	1365841	But you have the lungs that you are born with, and you have the heart that you're born with.
1365922	1370826	And so at a certain point in time, I can't bring enough oxygen in, or maybe I can't pump enough blood.
1371857	1382703	So those are a couple limitations, but eventually your body cannot absorb or consume more oxygen, no matter the power that I kind of put that individual on.
1383163	1385505	And so they reach a physiological ceiling.
1388866	1398292	So some of those factors, maximum ability of cardiorespiratory system to deliver oxygen to the muscles, or the ability of the muscles to use the oxygen and produce ATP aerobically.
1399252	1400753	So you can imagine if I had
1404047	1414620	a well-developed heart, lungs, blood, and all of that, but then all of a sudden I take away half your mitochondria, well, that could be a problem for you to actually consume that oxygen.
1415561	1417343	So that's what that bottom one's kind of talking about.
1422538	1426421	Okay, exercise intensity and fuel selection at low intensity exercise.
1426841	1429864	Fats are the primary fuel that is being utilized.
1430304	1434628	At high exercise intensity, carbohydrates are the primary fuel.
1438330	1443254	We kinda talked about this before, so this should be a little bit of review, and I think you've seen this in your labs as well.
1445516	1450280	Which is why I know this question's gonna be on your exam then.
1454342	1459527	You're going to get 100 here, and we're going to put this on the exam here.
1460388	1464372	What happens to R or RER as exercise intensity increases?
1518227	1521328	OK, let's go maybe 30, 45 seconds more.
1523430	1527391	Does anyone need more help setting this up or setting your clicker up?
1550593	1551773	All right, 30 more seconds.
1552113	1553654	Make sure you have something clicked in.
1553674	1568738	All right, 10 seconds here.
1568758	1576760	I'll close this down in three, two, one.
1581565	1583346	All right, so I'm gonna show this.
1589608	1590349	We did pretty good.
1591189	1591729	I'll take that.
1591809	1600333	I know some of you were like, oh, 86%, if there was an 86% average on the exam, oh man, I'd throw everyone a party in here.
1600453	1601993	Like, I'd take that all day long.
1602394	1607296	So don't worry, 86, yeah, that's not 100, but I'm okay with that.
1607436	1608096	That's pretty good.
1608596	1609877	Let's talk about this really quick.
1610736	1616820	Right, if I increase exercise intensity, what are we trying to utilize more of?
1618140	1620101	Carbs, yep, just like what we talked about.
1620602	1625805	On the RER chart, if I'm at 100% carbohydrate, what's that RER value?
1626785	1628226	One, and then if I'm at 100% fat, what are we at?
1631020	1631580	0.7, good.
1631880	1643006	So if we look at this chart over here, and if I'm moving from 0% carbohydrate to 100, we're getting closer to ones who are increasing the RER.
1646327	1659313	Okay, so as carbohydrates are increasing with exercise intensity and fats are kind of decreasing, well eventually you're gonna have these two lines kind of cross, which you can kind of imply from this table right here.
1661873	1666435	Where these two lines cross is called the crossover concept.
1667636	1679382	So this, pretty much this crossover point is the point at which our body switches over from primarily fat oxidation to primarily carbohydrate oxidation.
1683043	1686085	As soon as we kind of move over from here,
1688111	1692815	Then again, we can kind of tell in individuals maybe at a certain intensity point.
1695717	1702163	So the next question you might ask yourself, what's causing this crossover concept or this crossover to occur?
1703664	1704845	Well, there are a few things.
1705646	1707107	We're gonna go over two of them.
1707527	1712672	One would be the recruitment of fast muscle fibers that are better equipped to metabolize carbohydrates than fats.
1719124	1728714	No.
1728874	1730255	We're gonna get into that in a second.
1730335	1731917	Yeah, can we hold on to that thought?
1732057	1732818	Okay, cool, cool.
1734810	1738092	OK, so recruitment of different muscle fibers.
1738392	1739313	And we'll get into this.
1739353	1747538	But if you remember from anatomy, you're kind of shifting from that type 1 to type 2 fiber recruitment as you are increasing exercise intensity.
1747978	1751120	And so we start to rely more on carbohydrates for that.
1752334	1756695	You also have increasing blood levels of epinephrine to stimulate glycogenolysis.
1756875	1766818	So very similar to what we saw with exercise duration, epinephrine and norepinephrine also increase with intensity.
1768839	1774260	So epinephrine and norepinephrine both increase with intensity and duration.
1775880	1780682	The magnitude is a little bit different, but don't worry about which one's more or which one's less.
1781562	1782622	They just both increase, yeah.
1795444	1798625	Yeah, yeah, so you're bringing up a really great question.
1798705	1804786	So if we have an increase in epinephrine, we just talked about how that's going to help with breakdown of triglycerides.
1805426	1806466	Hang on to that thought.
1806486	1807967	We're going to touch into that.
1808127	1809147	Well, I guess we can.
1812276	1815959	Where do we store most of our adipose tissue?
1818761	1821883	You don't have to say like exact location, but in the muscle or not in the muscle?
1822564	1823284	Not in the muscle.
1823945	1828148	When you are increasing exercise intensity, where do you want to send most of the blood?
1829622	1849875	to the muscle and so as you increase in exercise intensity, you start to divert a lot of the blood to the muscle and so that's less blood flow to going to the liver or some of the adipose tissue and so it actually reduces or blunts some of the ability for you to sequester some of the triglycerides or free fatty acids from the triglycerides.
1850416	1853758	But we'll touch on a few other mechanisms that are kind of impairing with that later.
1857033	1862075	OK, so influence on exercise intensity on muscle fuel source.
1862135	1867797	This is very similar to the figure we saw with the four kind of lines going out on that grid.
1868617	1871639	Here we have exercise intensity 25, 65, and 85, the percent of fuel source used.
1875720	1883284	We can see that plasma-free fatty acids are the primary energy source at these lower exercise intensities, like 25%.
1884945	1889607	But as we increase in that exercise intensity, they start to get lower and lower and lower.
1890448	1895290	And what we start to rely more and more on would be the muscle glycogen, which is this top blue bar.
1895631	1901714	So as we increase in exercise intensity, we're increasing the utilization from glycogen.
1907975	1921441	Just like fat oxidation as you increase the duration with training, you can shift the crossover concept as well with exercise intensity.
1923141	1929084	So for this, if we have this fat oxidation here in this dark line,
1929939	1935260	And then this dotted line over here, we have the carbohydrate utilization.
1936281	1939841	With training, you shift the crossover point to the right.
1942822	1950624	So it doesn't have it necessarily here, but if you go back to the other figure, the crossover point was around 30% to 40%.
1951944	1955005	And then with training, you push it kind of to the right.
1957956	1967443	And if I'm just looking at the estimated kind of R over here, no surprise, the R kind of shifts down and to the right.
1972521	1987664	I like this curve a little bit better because you can draw one crossover concept, then draw an arrow to the right, maybe draw another crossover to that, and then you can see, well, how many carbohydrates or fat am I using at 60%?
1988624	1996126	Well, this is around 40% over here, but if the old crossover was down here, then it would be closer to 20%.
2000825	2011268	So the whole name of the game, then, would be both scenarios you're trying to oxidize or use more fat at higher intensities so that you can spare those glycogen molecules.
2020430	2030233	Interestingly, regardless if you are trained or untrained, this crossover concept occurs really close to something called the lactate threshold.
2031568	2033189	So that'll be our next concept here.
2035091	2039935	Before I move on to this, are we okay with exercise intensity and substrate utilization?
2042337	2049323	Anytime you see a problem that deals with substrate utilization, you need to almost like box off two concepts, duration and intensity.
2050525	2057551	Once you have those two concepts kind of written or kind of straightened out, then you can try to answer the question.
2058548	2070195	Because if you mix the two together and you try to apply, like you say, oh, as I increase with exercise duration, now I'm getting carbohydrate utilization to go up, well, that would be a problem.
2070255	2074958	So just make sure you separate the two and then you look at them a little bit more separate.
2076238	2085584	Yes, they kind of happen at the same time, but at least for this course, we're really gonna assess you on whether you can identify duration versus intensity.
2089497	2090497	Okay, lactate threshold.
2092418	2107220	Just to kind of bring you back over here, if we're in this space where we're looking at glycolysis and we're producing a little bit of pyruvate, that pyruvate kind of bounces into lactate dehydrogenase and then we get lactate.
2110541	2111661	I like to start with this.
2112541	2115622	You will not need to know these different terms.
2116564	2122487	but there are a lot of terms out there when trying to describe this concept.
2124048	2132572	Anaerobic threshold, onset of blood lactate accumulation, onset of plasma lactate accumulation, maximal steady state, critical power, lactate break point.
2133213	2135734	There are a ton of researchers that use different terms.
2136534	2143098	The reason why I like to put this up here is because depending on the paper or the book that you read, you could see one of these things.
2144138	2151821	They all generally are referring to the same concept, but sometimes they kind of put them on different spectrums as far as intensity.
2152521	2158524	So there's another one on here that's like one millimolar above lactate break point, things like that.
2159404	2162385	So this is just more for your information.
2162425	2164586	Don't worry, you'll never be tested on this.
2165026	2171709	Just know that people set the lactate threshold at different lactate concentrations or powers.
2174280	2175401	Okay, so lactate threshold.
2175441	2181006	This is the work rate at which blood lactate rises systematically during a graded exercise test.
2181667	2199884	What that means is if I have an exercise intensity down on the x-axis, whether that's in relative or absolute, so speed versus percent VO2 max, and then on the y we have lactate concentration, as I increase the intensity,
2202188	2209792	your blood lactate actually does not change as the workloads are getting harder to a certain point.
2211813	2216055	Then at that point, you start to get a systematic rise in blood lactate.
2217316	2219157	So that's this inflection point here.
2224279	2229042	Typically, we see this around 50 to 60% VO2 max in untrained individuals.
2230335	2232736	and then we see it a little bit higher in trained subjects.
2234176	2248822	This is the average range here, but we have sampled lactate or lactate levels or lactate threshold in the United States Olympic development team, like the runners, and some of them are in the low 90s, like 92%.
2251770	2257035	And so what they are trying to do is they're trying to push this threshold as far to the right as possible.
2257776	2262320	So this blue line would be trained individuals and the red line would be the untrained individuals.
2263301	2274251	So they're trying to push this as far to the right as possible so they can maintain this flat lactate concentration for higher intensities.
2279465	2293731	Okay, so hopefully you're okay with this concept and the next question in the back of your mind might be like, okay, well, this is nice to see that we have this flat piece, but what's actually causing the increase in this lactate concentration?
2295692	2298593	Here are some potential mechanisms to explain the lactate threshold.
2300414	2302895	One would be low muscle glycogen.
2304336	2306517	I'm gonna try to emphasize as best as I can.
2307660	2309641	This is not well accepted.
2311322	2318466	There are probably only a few people out there as far as like exercise physiologists that actually believe this is true.
2319707	2327731	The reason why it's still here on this chart though is because some people still have this idea that it's due to low muscle oxygen.
2327751	2329532	And we'll get into that in just a little bit.
2331740	2334022	The next would be accelerated glycolysis.
2334583	2342649	No surprise if I'm creating more pyruvate while I'm increasing the chances that pyruvate's gonna bump into that enzyme and get converted to lactate.
2343430	2344510	Seems reasonable to me.
2345231	2350015	Recruitment of fast-twitch fibers, that also seems reasonable to me.
2350815	2360083	But that doesn't necessarily tell me whether, all these are telling me is that I'm increasing in the lactate production.
2362470	2368333	What we need to kind of keep in the back of our mind is, our body actually uptakes lactate.
2370193	2378317	If we just had these three pieces here, then we wouldn't see this one.
2380018	2387821	Because at every single one of these intensities here, especially for the train one, glycolysis is increasing at every single one of these points.
2388758	2390739	And you are recruiting more fast-twitch fibers.
2391259	2392859	So you are producing more lactate.
2393760	2396961	But you're still not getting an increase in lactate concentration here.
2400242	2405664	And so what we need to keep in the back of our mind is that we actually remove lactate from the blood.
2406744	2409686	And another piece could be a reduced rate of lactate removal.
2412106	2416268	If you take all of this as kind of in total,
2418217	2421139	This is the take home message that you should probably look at.
2422681	2434830	Blood lactate concentration is just this formula of rate of appearance minus the rate of disappearance or the rate of removal.
2436412	2438393	How much are you putting into the blood?
2439234	2440955	And then how much are you taking out?
2442577	2445339	At these lower intensities, you're almost at like zero.
2447985	2453267	So that's the biggest thing we need to kind of keep in mind of what's causing the lactate threshold.
2454908	2461291	I don't know specifically if I'm removing less or just producing more.
2462912	2477458	So if you think of like a bucket of water and I turn on a faucet to fill up the bucket and then I poke a hole in the bottom, well if I match the rate that the bucket is losing water with the faucet, the water level should not change.
2478833	2482155	But if I turn on the faucet more, yeah, you're gonna get an accumulation of that water.
2483196	2490601	Or instead of turning on the faucet and just leave the faucet at the same rate, I make the hole a little bit bigger or smaller, that will change the water level.
2491401	2499086	So I don't know, we don't know as researchers if it's the rate of removal versus the rate of production.
2502328	2505090	And it does depend on the individual as well as the type of exercise.
2506869	2511712	All we know is it's this kind of rate of removal versus the rate of appearance.
2516636	2520218	We don't need to break out into a group, but this is kind of just a fun thing.
2520298	2522940	How do we actually get this?
2523401	2527143	How do we measure blood lactate levels over time during graded exercise tests?
2527624	2530586	Maybe some of you have already done it, but any ideas?
2533808	2533928	Yeah.
2535553	2536874	Yeah, you do a little finger stick.
2537655	2541498	Sometimes you can actually poke the back of the earlobe.
2542299	2543480	That one's a little bit easier.
2543520	2545322	And some people are like, oh, I don't know if I like that.
2545362	2551087	But for cycling, if your hands are on the handlebars, well, it's a little bit easier to access the ear.
2553128	2557052	For running, typically we have them kind of put their hand out on the treadmill.
2557532	2558313	We just poke the finger.
2562503	2568907	The nice thing about this is if I can get someone's lactate threshold, we can do some pretty cool stuff.
2568987	2572149	We can predict endurance performance pretty well.
2573630	2583916	We do need to combine this with running economy and some of the better predictions also include things like kinetics, critical power, as well as VO2 max.
2585557	2588879	The other nice thing would be we can plan some training programs.
2590413	2601539	If the idea is let's push the lactate threshold to the right as far as possible, well then we need to spend the most amount of our training inside of that lactate threshold range.
2601699	2608983	So a little bit above, maybe right at it to try to push that curve and stress the body to get it to move to the right.
2613857	2619600	You'll be working with this formula in lab, so I won't spend too much time with this.
2620460	2635446	But essentially, your 10K race time does a really good job for your ability to run 10 kilometers is very closely linked to where your lactate threshold occurs as far as pacing.
2636547	2639048	So we can then predict performance in 10K race.
2639108	2641069	We need to determine the lactate threshold.
2642325	2643846	And then we can measure VO2 max.
2645147	2653735	We input these into a different formula that you won't be responsible for, but we can estimate the 10K running time using this formula here.
2659200	2660100	So what does that look like?
2660421	2664543	Okay, well, we'll draw kind of one line over this way on the lactate threshold.
2664583	2673267	So if you have oxygen uptake or intensity on the X axis and then blood lactate on the Y, we draw one line to establish that baseline lactate.
2673807	2676869	And then once we see that systematic rise, we'll draw another line.
2677309	2684553	And wherever those points intersect, we pretty much drop that towards the intensity and we know where their lactate threshold is around.
2685930	2689493	You will not be taking lactate samples in lab.
2690173	2694957	We'll instead use something called the ventilatory threshold, which behaves very similarly.
2696738	2701902	It's not a direct measure of lactate threshold, but it gives us a good idea of where lactate threshold might be around.
2703843	2705585	And then you can plug in these values here.
2706105	2711909	And then for this particular individual, we are predicting them to finish the 10K time in about 48.78 minutes.
2719140	2720122	Any questions on this?
2724329	2725290	All right, nice.
2727394	2732302	So then we get into this next concept about lactate.
2733709	2734269	and fatigue.
2734910	2744854	How many of you have heard that lactate is either some sort of contributor or influencing an individual's to fatigue?
2744894	2748435	So lactate causes fatigue, lactate causes soreness or discomfort, right?
2748455	2750616	We've all probably heard that term before.
2752137	2756299	So then, what could we do then to test this?
2759397	2763360	What's like the most extreme example as to how we could test this?
2765622	2773709	Yeah, you could inject lactate, but then you wouldn't know though that maybe still the lower concentrations are still contributing.
2774809	2781415	What's the extreme way, we can't really do this, but what's the extreme way on the reverse side of that?
2788884	2793665	Yeah, so what if we just eliminated lactate production altogether?
2793685	2796546	Well, that seems pretty nice, right?
2796586	2810569	Because if I eliminate lactate production at all from exercise, then they shouldn't have any type of fatigue, and they shouldn't have the muscle soreness or the burning, right?
2810889	2812850	That seems reasonable, but we can't do that.
2813896	2814456	Or can we?
2814976	2815496	No, we can't.
2815796	2818697	But there is something called McArdle's disease.
2819717	2823738	So McArdle's disease is a very interesting genetic mutation.
2824658	2839021	So there's an error in the muscle glycogen where these individuals cannot synthesize the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, which means they cannot break down glycogen and glycolysis does not occur.
2840802	2840942	Whoa.
2842292	2849035	That's a tough deal for them, but this gave researchers a pretty interesting idea.
2849755	2856938	What if we check these lactate levels and see what happens during exercise?
2857579	2864422	So here on this top curve, we have blood lactate, and then we have percent of relative VO2 max.
2865702	2872343	The dark or the solid lines are McArdle's patients and the dotted lines are controls, normal healthy controls.
2874504	2884906	As we increase exercise intensity all the way to 100, no surprise that the levels of lactate do not change in these McArdle's patients.
2885846	2888387	But the controls do have a lactate threshold.
2890787	2893188	Nice, at least the experimental model worked.
2894150	2902075	We're seeing no change in lactate in these Mercadil's patients, but we're seeing an exponential increase in lactate concentration in the controls.
2903436	2905777	Well, maybe something else was going on with ventilation.
2905897	2908459	No, they're still having an increase in ventilation.
2908559	2910920	So there's an excess buildup of hydrogen ions.
2911200	2915603	They're undergoing the bicarb buffering system, and they're having some hyperventilation.
2917724	2921447	And they also see the same in controls.
2924623	2933071	But, McCardell's patients, they do not tolerate exercise very well.
2934091	2947924	There's a big issue with these individuals or these patients that the main complaint during any type of exercise activity is the soreness, the burning, and the fatigue.
2950215	2961749	So it's quite interesting that they are experiencing the same issues that we experience albeit at a lower intensity with no lactate.
2963534	2967677	There's also those pieces where we talked about, I think someone had mentioned infusing lactate.
2967977	2972600	Well, if I infuse lactate at a higher concentration, it's not like our whole body starts to burn.
2973060	2978824	And then someone can argue, well, maybe it's because there's a higher lactate concentration inside of the muscle compared to the blood.
2978844	2981305	And that's true, but then you still can't get past this.
2988249	2992132	So then if they can't break down carbohydrate sources, what are they using?
2994553	2996434	to do the exercise or any type of activity.
2998495	2999616	There's only one other option.
3000216	3000956	Fats, right?
3000976	3007159	So not surprisingly, McArdle's patients use more fat as a fuel compared to control subjects during submaximal exercise.
3008060	3010041	However, this is pretty interesting.
3011121	3017644	Despite the rising levels of fatty acids in the blood, McArdle's patients are not able to oxidize more fat.
3018825	3019065	What?
3019085	3020566	What's going on?
3021621	3024904	These poor micartos patients, they're just struggling the whole way through.
3026625	3036333	This introduced this idea of how fats need to burn in the flame of a carbohydrate.
3037254	3042799	So carbohydrate availability limits fat oxidation even during steady state exercise in these patients.
3043459	3047182	The idea is that if you reduce
3048433	3051914	some of the important substrates of the Krebs cycle.
3052094	3060158	So maybe you're not just producing some of the four carbons in a higher quantity when you're burning carbohydrates as opposed to only fats.
3060538	3066340	And you start limiting the ability to produce or run through the Krebs cycle.
3067889	3073511	And so this idea that fats must burn in the flame of carbohydrates came from these researchers.
3074331	3081273	So glycogen is depleted during prolonged high-intensity exercise, and so we're reducing the rate of glycolysis and production of pyruvate.
3081753	3084994	You're also reducing a lot of the Krebs cycle intermediaries.
3085635	3091336	So alpha-ketoglutaric acid might be in high demand, but low availability.
3092037	3096538	And that overall, this idea is you're reducing fat oxidation.
3102445	3114393	This isn't like, there's still a lot of research that needs to go on in this area to really confirm whether this is happening, but the theory seems reasonable.
3117935	3118656	Any questions here?
3120577	3120877	Okay.
3123259	3125080	So then that gets us into another one, right?
3125120	3127742	We're gonna tackle a few things all today.
3129183	3130064	Lactate threshold.
3131137	3133158	We're having trouble burning fat.
3135378	3138639	We're going to talk about this concept called the fat burning zone.
3141820	3143320	There's no right or wrong answer.
3143340	3144521	Well, there is a right or wrong answer.
3144561	3151283	But just answer maybe what you previously thought or what you currently believe now.
3153272	3154574	This is a low stakes question.
3154774	3160502	As you increase exercise intensity, you shift from primarily burning fats to burning carbohydrates.
3161102	3164867	Therefore, to lose the most weight, you should exercise at low intensities.
3165608	3166469	True or false?
3167190	3170455	Feel free to discuss with your classmates and we'll take like a minute.
3236716	3238737	Okay, let's go maybe 30 more seconds.
3238817	3240117	Double check you have an answer in.
3240558	3242498	We're missing I think like 15 clickers here.
3242518	3249581	There we go, five more.
3249601	3264227	Okay, I'll close this down in three, two, one.
3269842	3280187	Okay, I like showing this poll here because it used to be like maybe 70, 30 on this end.
3280827	3285149	So maybe this isn't as much of a myth as once thought.
3285529	3286569	But can I get some ideas?
3287230	3288130	So what are we thinking here?
3288830	3291271	So it's a safe space, it's okay if you put yes or no.
3292172	3292912	Tell me what you're thinking.
3305129	3309376	Yeah, yeah, and where did that come from, I guess, because of this top concept?
3311139	3312181	Yeah, no, I would agree.
3313583	3316589	Any counter arguments to that?
3317808	3337660	if you're trying to use cardio to lose weight, even though the percentages of carbs to fat or calories being burned might be or fats to carbs might be higher at lower intensities, you're going to end up burning more calories regardless at a higher intensity.
3337700	3340582	So you might as well just do higher intensity.
3341392	3343254	Yeah, yeah, no, I like that thought too.
3343314	3355506	So it's basically, even though you're getting a larger contribution from fats at a lower intensity, so a higher percent, if you exercise at a higher intensity, you're getting an increase in total energy expenditure.
3355746	3356867	So I really like that one.
3357788	3361372	But the true piece, you're not alone.
3363424	3367466	How many, this is even in your textbook, how many of you have seen this before?
3368106	3378511	If you want to lose weight, in particular, burn fat, fat burning, you need to stay in the light to very light zone.
3379551	3390456	We need to be in the low intensity to maximize the fat oxidation or the fat burning, which brought us into this fat burning zone myth.
3391456	3392337	Where did they get this?
3393934	3396376	from probably what most of you are thinking right here.
3396956	3410928	If I look at this teal curve, if I wanna burn the most fat as far as a percent here, just looking at this curve, if someone showed me this curve, I would say I need to be at the lowest intensity to burn the most fat.
3413850	3422337	But that's not necessarily what ends up happening because if I am walking around campus for an hour,
3424343	3425563	and I burn 100 calories.
3428124	3435065	Maybe 99% of the calories of the 100 are coming from fat, right?
3435185	3439646	That seems great, but what if I ran or jogged around campus for an hour?
3441126	3453048	Well, now I'm burning maybe 600 calories, and even though I'm only taking 50%, well, that 50% is from a larger piece of a pie, so now I'm burning 300 calories from fat.
3454040	3464963	And so we'll get into this here, where at low intensities, say 20% VO2 max, maybe the total energy expenditure is three kcals per minute.
3466544	3473446	If the R or the RER is 0.8, 67% of the energy is coming from fat.
3474346	3481408	So a higher fat oxidation compared to a carbohydrate oxidation.
3482605	3489509	Let's take some time, not too long, but let's calculate how many kcals are gonna come from fat here.
3489729	3490830	It shouldn't take you too long.
3491551	3494272	And then calculate how many kcals are coming from carbohydrates.
3495313	3496454	So let's spend a couple minutes.
3496974	3501857	It'll be a relatively straightforward calculation here, but let's just do that really fast.
3580075	3581298	Okay, how are we doing with this one?
3581819	3582160	Pretty good?
3582180	3587311	You're just pretty much doing 67% of the total, right?
3588614	3588995	And then, okay.
3591428	3592829	So we're at 20% VO2 max.
3592849	3596490	We'll go over these calculations in a bit, but we're gonna try one more.
3596510	3598491	20% VO2 max, three kcal per minute.
3598991	3606974	If I bump us up to 60% VO2 max, nine kcal per minute, and we get an R of .9, 33% energy from fat.
3607014	3611876	Let's calculate how many kcal per minute are coming from fat and carbohydrates.
3612356	3614017	And these are real numbers here, right?
3614797	3617058	You will all see these numbers yourselves
3618642	3621880	Well, not all of you, but whoever's volunteering to exercise next week.
3661412	3663854	OK, don't worry if you're not there yet.
3664114	3674240	But on that first one, was it like 67% of your carb, 67% of the energy that you just expended are coming from fats.
3674841	3676682	Around how many kcal per minute would that be?
3678902	3679182	Say again?
3679883	3680683	Close to two, right?
3681223	3681464	Yeah.
3681764	3691970	So if you just took this, I know it's not exactly, but yeah, around 67 times 3, we're getting 2 kcals per minute from fat and 1 kcal per minute from carbohydrates.
3692650	3703097	No one's going to argue that this lower intensity had a higher fat oxidation rate from a relative standpoint, the percentage.
3705166	3712888	And then same deal, no one's gonna argue that as you increase exercise intensity, you're gonna have a decrease in the relative contribution from fat.
3713868	3718430	But look at that, three Kcal per minute from fat versus two.
3721971	3723471	Web of lies, right?
3723711	3725852	We've just been fed all these lies, they're all lies.
3726132	3727092	Just kidding, no, it's okay.
3727792	3728832	Why is this happening?
3729833	3734214	Well, if you were to actually plot this at every single exercise intensity,
3735366	3739675	we actually get into something called the maximum fat oxidation rate.
3742072	3745115	There are a lot of athletes that we build these curves for.
3745475	3750980	This is something that athletes do like, and sometimes people who are undergoing any type of exercise training program.
3751740	3768435	We can actually look and see if this here, this on the left y-axis is R, or RER, on the right is the absolute, so grams per minute fat oxidation here on the right y-axis.
3770179	3772701	And then on the bottom here we have exercise intensity.
3774242	3794237	As we increase in exercise intensity, the absolute fat oxidation rate increases up to a certain point where the exercise intensity starts to have such a small contribution from fat that we actually start to decrease in this fat oxidation rate.
3796779	3797459	So I guess the,
3798822	3810912	Moral of the story with this one is, well, there are some exercise intensities that are too high to have a high absolute fat oxidation rate, and some of them are too low.
3813014	3824543	We need to kind of build this curve to find where that maximum fat oxidation rate is to try to capture in how much, or if someone is really trying to burn the most amount of fat.
3829012	3830973	So this is pretty good, right?
3831053	3833914	OK, I need to be maybe around 60%.
3836836	3841598	Interestingly enough, that also occurs very close to one's lactate threshold.
3843238	3852843	So at 60% intensity, you are actually burning the most fat compared to any other intensity in this given example here.
3855804	3856984	All right, so maybe you're thinking, man,
3859799	3870423	Are we really towing the line here between maximum fat oxidation from here to here because we're looking at point three versus point four?
3871643	3876505	Well, yeah, that could add up over multiple sessions as you are exercising.
3877946	3879046	Here's the other part.
3879806	3880727	This is the nice part.
3882347	3886589	Not only do you burn more fat during exercise,
3887828	3891009	that you actually burn more after exercise.
3893170	3903214	So this is the post-exercise resting metabolic rate, RMR, and how it becomes elevated after higher intensity exercise.
3904014	3907095	So we're looking at 80 minutes of high intensity cycling.
3909256	3912957	If I'm looking at different exercise intensity down here, so 30%, 50%, and 75%,
3917872	3924238	And we're looking at, on the right side here, caloric expenditure post exercise.
3925799	3928121	So don't worry too much about this black curve.
3928201	3930483	This is just telling us how long it was elevated.
3931024	3934607	Well, I guess that is pretty nice because that's 10 hours after exercise.
3934667	3943015	But after all of that, just during rest, so they undergo 80 minutes of high intensity exercise,
3944248	3948991	and then you take them off the bike and you lay them and have them quietly rest or sleep.
3950151	3961117	You measure the caloric expenditure during rest and they are burning 151 calories after exercise compared to 7 and 29 at 30 and 50%.
3963919	3970242	When I am resting, what percent would you say I would be utilizing from fat?
3972483	3975444	around, we don't need an exact number, but 100.
3975564	3978466	I'd say like 99.9, but yeah, 100, right?
3978486	3984168	150 of those 151 calories are coming from fat.
3985088	3991051	So not only did you burn more during exercise, but you start burning more after exercise.
3993512	3994612	Whoa, right?
3994632	3995433	That's pretty cool.
3996953	3997954	So why is this happening?
4000705	4006648	Well there's something that we need to look at which is the kind of epoch exercise post-oxygen consumption.
4009129	4015373	Oxygen uptake remains elevated above rest while we are recovering from exercise.
4016994	4022957	That again is called excess post-exercise oxygen consumption
4027402	4037986	So previously termed as oxygen depth, sometimes you'll hear this term, but we don't really use that term for epoch anymore because we put it at the start of exercise basically.
4039207	4043369	This means the O2 consumed is greater than the O2 demand.
4044509	4048191	We have two separate portions that we're gonna talk about here in the next slide.
4048971	4050872	It's the rapid portion and the slow portion, yep.
4058782	4059262	This one right here?
4059863	4063866	Okay.
4065407	4069089	Yeah, but if I, so that's a good question.
4069269	4081178	If I then push this to 90%, you are correct that things start to linger a bit more, but it becomes a little bit more problematic because you might not be able to sustain that exercise for 80 minutes.
4082893	4090274	So as I increase in exercise intensity by default, if I told you to sprint as fast as you can, well, that's probably going to be like 15 seconds.
4090935	4093695	And so you're not going to see this as large of an increase.
4094155	4096496	And that's why that fat oxidation starts to curl down.
4097276	4105537	So if you stay on that max fat oxidation intensity and you maintain that, you'll get kind of the dual benefit during exercise and post exercise.
4105557	4106898	So that would be a combination of the two.
4107098	4108558	Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah.
4112937	4115359	Okay, so these are the two parts, right?
4115419	4119542	If we're looking at moderate exercise, so kind of the lower intensity exercise.
4120683	4133253	We talked about this already, where if you jump on a treadmill and start exercising, you don't automatically have a heart rate, ventilation, and oxygen consumption that matches the energy demand.
4134074	4137517	It takes a little bit of time for us to reach steady state.
4139659	4142241	Anything that's shaded on the left of this
4143575	4146776	Well, we had to use what kind of sources to keep us on the treadmill?
4151178	4154539	Yeah, anaerobic or non-oxidative or those immediate energy sources.
4155560	4158341	We had to rely on those to keep us running.
4159001	4161242	And that's why that's deemed like O2 debt.
4161802	4162843	We didn't use oxygen.
4163303	4165744	The demand was much higher than what we actually utilized.
4166824	4168825	Okay, and then we stop exercise at six minutes.
4169995	4172116	And you all have probably experienced this before.
4172376	4177618	Maybe you're running after the bus or you're running late to class or you're just kind of exercising and then you sit down.
4178298	4181940	Well, you don't sit down and automatically your heart rate drops and your ventilation drops.
4182460	4184821	No, it takes a little bit for you to settle down.
4186521	4188162	That's what this piece is here.
4188222	4195685	If I shade this in, you are not doing any work, but you are still consuming oxygen here.
4196772	4200573	This initial slope here is the rapid component.
4201693	4206275	And then once the slope starts to flatten out, that's the slow component.
4209996	4221399	If then I bump you up to a harder exercise intensity, you will see a larger O2 debt and a larger epoch.
4225445	4230389	Here we are almost saying they have reached VO2 max.
4232911	4244200	In order for this individual to sustain the exercise from oxidative phosphorylation, they would need to consume 4.5 liters per minute.
4245601	4249485	For whatever reason, they are unable to do that.
4250626	4252707	And so the maximum oxygen consumption is 3.5.
4254933	4259515	That means they are an O2 deficit all the way up to this 4.5 spot.
4262896	4269038	Once you stop exercise, you can see the dramatic change in epoch.
4270239	4276041	So this one kind of flattened out almost to baseline after, what is that, four minutes after exercise?
4276961	4277822	Whereas this one,
4279102	4287247	we're kind of delaying this all the way out to almost 14 minutes and it didn't even flatten off and this actually extends for quite a long time.
4292470	4301215	And so you can see the rapid component and the slow component are much longer compared to moderate exercise.
4306023	4314971	Though it's not the only contributing factor, a larger O2 debt will result in a larger epoch.
4317033	4329765	So if I draw a larger area under the curve over here or under this line, then that will be, so larger O2 debt, larger epoch.
4330105	4331487	So if I'm just shading this in,
4333132	4339796	If you actually take this area, you take the integral of this and the integral of that, they actually don't equal one to one.
4339816	4340176	So it's not 100%.
4342118	4345600	But if I see a large O2 debt, I know there's going to be a large epoch.
4350002	4351623	So then what are all the factors?
4351984	4354185	Well, here are the factors contributing to epoch.
4356338	4370648	This one over here, restoration of muscle and blood oxygen stores and the resynthesis of phosphocreatine are gonna contribute to the rapid portion of EPOC, whereas the conversion of lactate to glucose as well as all of these others are gonna contribute to the slow component.
4379194	4379995	Any questions here?
4384317	4384618	All right.
4384638	4386763	Well, that's all I have for you.
4386863	4387825	Enjoy your weekend.
4388707	4389209	Have a good one.
