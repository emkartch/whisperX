1
00:02:16,128 --> 00:02:17,489
OK, welcome back.

2
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:24,856
Very briefly, before we get started, this Monday, March

3
00:02:24,856 --> 00:02:34,686
3, I'm hosting a colloquium speaker that typically happens every Monday for this semester at 11.15.

4
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:45,136
But the speaker that I'm hosting on Monday, so Dr. Hokehammer, he

5
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:47,738
Did a post-doc here at CU, and we did some of

6
00:02:47,738 --> 00:02:51,842
the original research together on those Nike, the first Nike

7
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:56,386
performance shoes, so those vapor flies that I think we had touched on.

8
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:58,708
So he's gonna be coming to give a talk on

9
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:05,835
the latest research on performance running shoes, and thought you might be interested.

10
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:15,123
No worries if you're not, but if you are, Humanities 250, Monday, March 3rd at 11.15 a.m.

11
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:21,954
That should be a pretty interesting talk.

12
00:03:21,954 --> 00:03:27,503
All right.

13
00:03:27,503 --> 00:03:32,691
So we're gonna pick up where we left off on Tuesday, circulatory responses to exercise.

14
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:34,414
So we're on that chapter nine.

15
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:39,605
We touched on, or I guess the last few slides that

16
00:03:39,605 --> 00:03:44,157
we looked at were regarding kind of this idea of the Wiggers diagram.

17
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:47,024
It gives us a really good idea of how pressure changes

18
00:03:47,024 --> 00:03:52,940
in the heart lead to blood kind of leaving or filling inside of the ventricles.

19
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,126
The Wiggers diagram is something that you all have seen before in physiology.

20
00:03:58,007 --> 00:04:00,410
I had mentioned that we are no longer, or at least

21
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,856
for exercise physiology, we're not going to be really worried about the Wiggers diagram.

22
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:07,039
But since you know the Wiggers diagram a little bit

23
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:14,789
better, it's nice to kind of reference the Wiggers diagram to get to the ventricle pressure-volume loop.

24
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:19,375
So we're now going to be using the pressure-volume loop.

25
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,478
As a reminder, we're going

26
00:04:22,673 --> 00:04:26,638
kind of up and then left down to the right.

27
00:04:26,638 --> 00:04:30,002
So this is the direction of the pressure volume loop.

28
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:37,792
Let's start off with trying to fill in some of these pieces here.

29
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:42,017
So we first talked about how if the mitral valve closes

30
00:04:42,017 --> 00:04:46,903
here and we have an increase in this pressure, well, the

31
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:51,563
pressure is increasing with no change in volume here.

32
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:57,232
And then when the aortic valve opens, you still get a little bit of an increase in pressure,

33
00:04:57,232 --> 00:05:01,458
but if you have that aortic valve opening, you get a

34
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:07,287
decrease in the amount of blood inside the ventricle because it's leaving the ventricle now.

35
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:13,296
And then during relaxation, the pressure drops, but you don't

36
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:18,043
get any movement in blood or blood volume doesn't change.

37
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,483
And then the mitral valve opens again.

38
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:27,474
Left ventricle volume goes up because it's passive and actively

39
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:30,720
filling up with blood for the next cardiac cycle.

40
00:05:31,702 --> 00:05:34,828
So what I would like you to do now is to fill

41
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:43,423
in the appropriate boxes on the pressure volume loop using what you know from the Wiger's diagram.

42
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:51,226
So keep in mind, on the x-axis, you have the left ventricular volume.

43
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:54,773
On the y-axis, you have left ventricular pressure.

44
00:05:56,236 --> 00:05:58,260
So let's take some time to label those.

45
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,408
I'll walk around if you have any questions, and then we'll come back in a couple minutes.

46
00:08:58,158 --> 00:08:59,160
OK, not too bad, right?

47
00:09:03,648 --> 00:09:04,670
Let's try this out then.

48
00:09:07,856 --> 00:09:10,461
Using the two diagrams, match the letters A through D

49
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:14,168
with the appropriate event in the left ventricle.

50
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:18,917
You pretty much have already done that, but let's put that in an order here.

51
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:29,871
Okay.

52
00:11:43,145 --> 00:11:58,723
Yeah, just to make sure, these A, B, C, D are A, B, C, D, if that helps.

53
00:13:02,137 --> 00:13:05,324
Okay, how are we doing here?

54
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:08,090
Anyone need a little more time?

55
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,275
I guess I do see people pointing, so that's good.

56
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:18,593
Let's go maybe another minute.

57
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,123
Okay, let's get something in.

58
00:14:24,123 --> 00:14:26,846
Double check you have an answer.

59
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,273
We'll close it down in 10 seconds.

60
00:14:38,082 --> 00:14:41,527
Okay, three, two, one.

61
00:14:45,012 --> 00:14:45,693
Okay, how do we do?

62
00:14:45,693 --> 00:14:48,317
I think we're a little bit between

63
00:14:50,238 --> 00:14:53,761
D and C, this is the correct answer.

64
00:14:53,761 --> 00:14:54,762
I won't grade that one.

65
00:14:56,144 --> 00:14:58,906
OK, so let's take a look at this.

66
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,031
D is correct.

67
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:09,937
If you had went with C, more than likely you're going

68
00:15:09,937 --> 00:15:13,500
the wrong way with some of these pieces here.

69
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:19,010
OK, so if we want to find isovolumetric contraction,

70
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,338
We actually want to be on this side.

71
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:26,337
So we know it's contraction for a couple reasons.

72
00:15:26,337 --> 00:15:26,758
One,

73
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:33,553
you typically have contraction once the left ventricle is at its highest volume.

74
00:15:34,874 --> 00:15:38,919
Because when we contract, we want to move the blood out of the heart.

75
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,563
So we have isovolumetric contraction.

76
00:15:42,563 --> 00:15:46,588
And even if you forgot what isovolumetric was, you

77
00:15:46,588 --> 00:15:51,113
would say the ventricles are contracting with no corresponding volume change.

78
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:56,880
So if you look here, I have an increase in pressure

79
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:01,345
But the volume down here on the x-axis is not changing.

80
00:16:02,387 --> 00:16:06,134
That's why it's isovolumetric contraction.

81
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:08,940
The pressure is going up.

82
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,909
Then eventually, the pressure inside the ventricle overcomes the

83
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:18,278
pressure on the aortic valve, and the aortic valve opens.

84
00:16:19,557 --> 00:16:24,785
As soon as that aortic valve opens, blood moves outside of

85
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:28,370
the ventricle and into the aorta to go to the rest of the body.

86
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:32,576
We know this from the pressure volume loop because the

87
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:38,705
volume is decreasing in the left ventricle, so it's going to the left over here, or to your right.

88
00:16:39,806 --> 00:16:41,910
No, your left, sorry.

89
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,692
So it's going this way over here.

90
00:16:47,157 --> 00:16:47,758
Then,

91
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:52,772
You can't maintain the contraction forever, so the heart relaxes.

92
00:16:55,215 --> 00:17:00,702
As soon as it relaxes, that valve closes down, the aortic valve, right?

93
00:17:00,702 --> 00:17:02,664
No blood can go back into the ventricle.

94
00:17:04,346 --> 00:17:09,132
So the pressure's decreasing, but there's no change in volume.

95
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:13,618
So you'd get your isovolumetric relaxation.

96
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,417
And then you get the filling.

97
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:18,637
Right?

98
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,182
You're going from a lower volume to a higher volume here.

99
00:17:24,525 --> 00:17:25,907
And then you start the cycle again.

100
00:17:29,773 --> 00:17:31,115
Any questions on this one?

101
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:40,107
Yeah?

102
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:47,277
Yeah, so B would be right here, so it would be isovolumetric contraction for B.

103
00:17:48,691 --> 00:17:53,941
And then isovolumetric relaxation would be D, which is down this way.

104
00:17:54,803 --> 00:17:57,147
So I'd put D in the second line right here.

105
00:17:59,451 --> 00:18:04,481
And then A, ventricle filling, would be right here.

106
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:08,308
This is A. And this represents the ventricle's filling.

107
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:09,571
We OK?

108
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:09,771
OK.

109
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:19,436
Any other questions on this one?

110
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:28,683
So it's a relatively straightforward kind of figure, but please

111
00:18:28,683 --> 00:18:32,755
make sure you spend some time on this one to understand what's going on at each point.

112
00:18:38,725 --> 00:18:41,589
Okay, cardiac output would be the next concept here.

113
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,313
Cardiac output you are already familiar with.

114
00:18:45,313 --> 00:18:49,398
It's the amount of blood pumped by the heart each minute.

115
00:18:49,398 --> 00:18:52,422
If I want to know the amount or the liters of blood

116
00:18:53,544 --> 00:18:59,151
per minute, then there are two things that you really need to have in play here to get cardiac output.

117
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:03,776
Number one would be heart rate because that gives you the number of beats per minute.

118
00:19:05,098 --> 00:19:06,640
And then stroke volume.

119
00:19:08,088 --> 00:19:12,373
which is basically how much blood is leaving per beat.

120
00:19:15,497 --> 00:19:19,341
Cardiac output does depend on training state as well as sex.

121
00:19:22,905 --> 00:19:24,507
What does that look like?

122
00:19:24,507 --> 00:19:31,615
Well, if we are looking at untrained male and females, the cardiac outputs are different.

123
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:36,216
So men tend to have higher cardiac outputs than women.

124
00:19:37,317 --> 00:19:43,204
And trained individuals tend to have higher cardiac output than untrained individuals.

125
00:19:44,526 --> 00:19:47,870
We also see differences between rest and max.

126
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:55,138
So we'll have the highest cardiac output during maximal exercise and the lowest during rest.

127
00:19:57,076 --> 00:19:59,699
So a few things going on right here.

128
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,901
We're comparing sex, differences in sex.

129
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:05,264
We're also comparing differences in training status.

130
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:10,830
And then this table's also comparing differences between rest and maximal exercise.

131
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:18,197
Okay.

132
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,623
Using kind of the idea of this table here,

133
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:32,257
we can get some good information or we can pair this with the pressure volume loop.

134
00:20:32,257 --> 00:20:32,998
Let's try this out.

135
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:39,927
A pressure volume loop is created for an untrained individual.

136
00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:43,752
This untrained individual is female and about 50

137
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:47,537
kilograms at rest and during different intensities.

138
00:20:48,898 --> 00:20:50,317
Let's

139
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:55,923
see which one of these pressure volume loops have been created.

140
00:20:56,904 --> 00:21:03,071
So you're trying to see when this pressure volume loop

141
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:09,838
was created during these three or none of these intensities.

142
00:21:13,943 --> 00:21:17,367
So make sure to reference the table before.

143
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:18,568
That's gonna help you out.

144
00:24:34,383 --> 00:24:38,308
Okay, double check you have something clicked in.

145
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:41,252
We'll close it down in 15 seconds here.

146
00:24:41,252 --> 00:24:51,044
Five seconds.

147
00:24:53,808 --> 00:24:56,451
Three, two, one.

148
00:24:57,313 --> 00:25:01,538
Okay, how did we do?

149
00:25:03,172 --> 00:25:06,859
B's the correct answer, but that's not great.

150
00:25:08,743 --> 00:25:13,032
Let's kind of break this down.

151
00:25:14,074 --> 00:25:20,647
First, we need to determine for this particular athlete here,

152
00:25:20,647 --> 00:25:23,593
what is their stroke volume, or a round.

153
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:26,654
75 to 80, right?

154
00:25:26,654 --> 00:25:28,116
So you're at 125.

155
00:25:28,116 --> 00:25:29,117
You're at 50 here.

156
00:25:29,117 --> 00:25:30,218
So that's at least 75.

157
00:25:30,218 --> 00:25:31,599
It's a little bit below.

158
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,541
OK, 75 to 80.

159
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:43,550
Then we need to reference what a untrained female who's around 50 kilograms.

160
00:25:44,671 --> 00:25:45,973
Well, would you look at that.

161
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:49,936
We have female who's around 50 kilograms.

162
00:25:49,936 --> 00:25:54,488
We have untrained at rest.

163
00:25:54,488 --> 00:25:55,870
their stroke volume's at 60.

164
00:25:57,352 --> 00:26:00,015
At maximal exercise, it's 90.

165
00:26:01,497 --> 00:26:06,383
So they're definitely not at rest, because they're working harder than being at rest.

166
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:10,127
And they're definitely not at max yet.

167
00:26:11,129 --> 00:26:13,672
They're actually pretty close to in between.

168
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,459
So in this instance, it would be submaximal exercise.

169
00:26:22,803 --> 00:26:23,584
Any questions?

170
00:26:31,647 --> 00:26:33,790
Because then now that we know what cardiac output is,

171
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:37,175
well, you've kind of known that already, let's break

172
00:26:37,175 --> 00:26:40,519
down the factors that actually regulate cardiac output.

173
00:26:42,082 --> 00:26:45,466
We need to go kind of step by step here.

174
00:26:45,466 --> 00:26:51,935
We're going to work our way first to the activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic system.

175
00:26:51,935 --> 00:26:54,499
And then we're going to break down stroke volume and heart rate.

176
00:26:57,432 --> 00:27:02,239
One of the two kind of mechanisms to regulate heart

177
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:05,423
rate would be the parasympathetic and the sympathetic system.

178
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:10,831
If we increase the activity of the sympathetic nervous system

179
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:13,936
to the heart, we are gonna increase heart rate.

180
00:27:15,237 --> 00:27:19,103
You also have a parasympathetic withdrawal.

181
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:26,985
So you are inhibiting the SA node less, and that's gonna help speed up heart rate.

182
00:27:26,985 --> 00:27:30,592
So you have those two major factors that are contributing

183
00:27:30,592 --> 00:27:34,459
to an increase in cardiac output, but primarily heart rate.

184
00:27:37,814 --> 00:27:40,801
Okay, so if we're at the autonomic nervous system,

185
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:47,156
we talked about the somatic motor pathway before when we were dealing with skeletal muscle.

186
00:27:47,156 --> 00:27:52,549
Now we're kind of moving over to this parasympathetic as well as the sympathetic pathway.

187
00:27:54,267 --> 00:27:57,393
You don't need to memorize these, but it is sometimes

188
00:27:57,393 --> 00:28:02,483
nice to know that the preganglionic fibers for

189
00:28:02,483 --> 00:28:10,118
both parasympathetic and sympathetic are releasing acetylcholine on the post synapse.

190
00:28:10,118 --> 00:28:12,644
Then on the post...

191
00:28:12,644 --> 00:28:14,607
ganglionic fibers here.

192
00:28:14,607 --> 00:28:18,612
Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that's being released to

193
00:28:18,612 --> 00:28:24,821
the target tissue in the parasympathetic, whereas the sympathetic is using norepinephrine.

194
00:28:26,984 --> 00:28:31,029
The reason why I point this out is because we

195
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:40,963
also have circulating epinephrine in the blood from the adrenal medulla.

196
00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:49,530
So we have these organs here releasing epinephrine into the blood.

197
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:59,761
They also can bind to these receptors to cause changes in heart rate and contractility.

198
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:05,243
So now I would never

199
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:09,623
tests you on the ganglia and the neurotransmitters.

200
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:12,094
But if you understand those two pieces, it might help

201
00:29:12,094 --> 00:29:14,123
you with some of the other mechanisms later on.

202
00:29:17,832 --> 00:29:22,538
Okay, so primarily for the parasympathetic vagus nerve,

203
00:29:22,538 --> 00:29:28,024
those are typically only kind of interfacing with or binding

204
00:29:28,024 --> 00:29:32,249
or sending their neurotransmitter to the SA and AV node.

205
00:29:32,249 --> 00:29:35,413
So they're really just kind of controlling the pace of

206
00:29:35,413 --> 00:29:39,398
the heart by influencing the AV and SA node.

207
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,182
The sympathetic nervous system.

208
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:53,944
does the same thing, AV NSA node, but it also has connections to the myocardium.

209
00:29:54,785 --> 00:29:59,472
So to the actual heart tissue, the muscles, the actual muscles.

210
00:30:01,455 --> 00:30:07,423
We sometimes call these sympathetic pathways cardiac accelerator nerves.

211
00:30:09,966 --> 00:30:11,869
And we'll touch on this again a little bit later.

212
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:18,716
Okay, so regulation of heart rate.

213
00:30:20,438 --> 00:30:22,380
This is the how, right?

214
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,842
So why does heart rate increase?

215
00:30:24,663 --> 00:30:28,227
Well, heart rate increases because we have to deliver more blood to the tissues.

216
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:30,931
How is heart rate increasing?

217
00:30:31,932 --> 00:30:33,994
We have two major pieces like we touched on.

218
00:30:33,994 --> 00:30:37,899
Parasympathetic nervous system has some sort of withdrawal.

219
00:30:39,721 --> 00:30:43,895
This is via the vagus nerve, which we just looked at on that previous figure.

220
00:30:43,895 --> 00:30:47,807
If you have the parasympathetic nervous system releasing

221
00:30:47,807 --> 00:30:51,720
that acetylcholine, it's gonna slow the heart rate by inhibiting the SA and AV node.

222
00:30:52,743 --> 00:30:57,398
So if you withdraw this activity, it's gonna help increase heart rate.

223
00:31:03,217 --> 00:31:08,747
OK, like I talked about, we have acetylcholine binding to these muscarinic cholinergic receptors.

224
00:31:08,747 --> 00:31:12,394
They cause these G-protein conformational changes.

225
00:31:12,394 --> 00:31:20,990
They're going to allow for potassium to leave, which is going to cause a hyperpolarization.

226
00:31:22,312 --> 00:31:24,837
It's also going to block calcium from coming in.

227
00:31:32,883 --> 00:31:39,357
If you have a hyperpolarization and you have positive ions leaving, it's going to reduce.

228
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,724
It's going to make it more negative.

229
00:31:42,724 --> 00:31:45,229
And you block positive ions from entering.

230
00:31:45,229 --> 00:31:46,852
So that's the hyperpolarization here.

231
00:31:50,801 --> 00:31:54,112
This is also considered the autorhythmic cell.

232
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:58,177
This is really helping us get our resting heart rate, right?

233
00:31:58,177 --> 00:32:03,023
It's just, you have that consistent heartbeat at rest.

234
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:07,088
Okay, number two, sympathetic nervous system.

235
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,353
These are via the cardiac accelerator nerves.

236
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:15,599
Those are the ones binding directly to the myocardium.

237
00:32:18,823 --> 00:32:22,448
And we can increase by stimulating the SA and AV node.

238
00:32:27,642 --> 00:32:32,428
So if you remember acetylcholine from the parasympathetic

239
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:35,733
nervous system, epinephrine for the sympathetic.

240
00:32:35,733 --> 00:32:38,837
So we have epinephrine or norepinephrine binding to these

241
00:32:38,837 --> 00:32:45,145
beta receptors here, cause some G protein conformational change, secondary messenger.

242
00:32:45,145 --> 00:32:49,851
Then you open these two channels that are gonna allow

243
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:52,755
for sodium and calcium to rush into the cell.

244
00:32:54,592 --> 00:32:57,422
That's gonna make the membrane potential get more positive

245
00:32:58,627 --> 00:33:00,875
and increase the chance you're gonna get an action potential.

246
00:33:01,818 --> 00:33:06,475
We call that depolarization when we're making the membrane potential more positive.

247
00:33:17,845 --> 00:33:21,369
So we talked about depolarization, hyperpolarization.

248
00:33:21,369 --> 00:33:25,413
This is another figure that helps with some of this.

249
00:33:26,314 --> 00:33:31,860
So the parasympathetic nervous system is going to make it more negative, hyperpolarize it.

250
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:36,946
And so it's going to be a little bit harder to get to this point here.

251
00:33:37,787 --> 00:33:40,450
And so that's the membrane potential threshold.

252
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:47,818
So any time the membrane reaches this millivolt, then it will generate an action potential.

253
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:52,005
It'll slowly creep up and then generate the action potential.

254
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:56,095
So if we hyperpolarize the cell, it's going to take

255
00:33:56,095 --> 00:34:01,690
a little bit longer before we reach that membrane potential to induce the action potential.

256
00:34:11,997 --> 00:34:16,586
So we're gonna skip this one here, but we'll move on to regulation of heart rate.

257
00:34:17,528 --> 00:34:22,257
So we know that we can, if from rest to maximal

258
00:34:22,257 --> 00:34:29,652
exercise, we usually see a pretty linear increase in heart rate, but it's never just like, oh,

259
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:36,129
We don't really see the mechanisms behind it, but we

260
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:39,552
can start to separate where the influence of the

261
00:34:39,552 --> 00:34:43,356
parasympathetic and the sympathetic nervous system are contributing.

262
00:34:44,297 --> 00:34:48,121
So the initial increase is due to parasympathetic withdrawal.

263
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:54,848
So around the first 40% of intensity, this is on average,

264
00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:59,613
that increase in heart rate, so when we see down here, this

265
00:34:59,613 --> 00:35:02,136
is intensity over here, and then we have heart rate,

266
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:07,070
The increase in heart rate up to around this point here

267
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:14,540
is primarily due to the withdrawal of the parasympathetic nervous system.

268
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,142
So it's not inhibiting as much.

269
00:35:20,147 --> 00:35:22,570
Again, on average, around 100 beats per minute.

270
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,514
So from rest up to that 100 beats per minute.

271
00:35:27,076 --> 00:35:30,230
Additional increases in heart rate

272
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:34,176
we actually need to stimulate the AV node.

273
00:35:34,176 --> 00:35:37,782
So we need to increase the signal that's being sent to it.

274
00:35:37,782 --> 00:35:40,927
And so that's happening with sympathetic nervous system outflow.

275
00:35:45,315 --> 00:35:46,496
So that's happening over here.

276
00:35:46,496 --> 00:35:49,481
So these increases on the back end or higher

277
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:54,870
intensities are primarily due to sympathetic nervous system activity.

278
00:35:56,453 --> 00:35:58,939
And you can always associate that with epinephrine.

279
00:35:58,939 --> 00:36:02,146
So circulating epinephrine as well as those cardiac

280
00:36:02,146 --> 00:36:07,138
accelerator nerves and the sympathetic nervous system attaching to the SA and AV nodes.

281
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:20,632
Okay, so we kinda touched on this before, but regulation

282
00:36:20,632 --> 00:36:25,539
of heart rate, a change in body temperature can influence heart rate during exercise.

283
00:36:25,539 --> 00:36:29,444
So if we have control here or cool room versus a

284
00:36:29,444 --> 00:36:33,629
heated room, and we have an individual who's exercising, there

285
00:36:33,629 --> 00:36:40,939
is a significant difference or an increase in the heart rate with an elevated temperature.

286
00:36:42,708 --> 00:36:46,994
And the reason why the heart does this is because you do get a drop in blood pressure

287
00:36:46,994 --> 00:36:49,778
because you're getting a little bit of vasodilation to

288
00:36:49,778 --> 00:36:53,342
the periphery because you're trying to send some of that blood to the skin.

289
00:36:54,945 --> 00:37:00,492
The heart or the body compensates by increasing heart rate to maintain perfusion pressure.

290
00:37:09,725 --> 00:37:11,567
Okay, let me ask you this question really quick.

291
00:37:14,804 --> 00:37:17,094
We won't take too long here, but having a really

292
00:37:17,094 --> 00:37:21,372
high heart rate during exercise means you are more fit.

293
00:38:01,987 --> 00:38:05,531
Okay, double check you have something in.

294
00:38:05,531 --> 00:38:08,514
Close this down in 10 seconds or so.

295
00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:13,981
Okay, five seconds.

296
00:38:17,164 --> 00:38:19,807
Three, two, one.

297
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:26,335
All right.

298
00:38:26,335 --> 00:38:28,838
Okay, yeah, most of you are saying false.

299
00:38:28,838 --> 00:38:30,019
That is correct.

300
00:38:30,826 --> 00:38:37,974
We cannot just base your heart rate or your maximal heart rate and link that to fitness.

301
00:38:39,175 --> 00:38:41,718
So if we think about the why does heart rate even

302
00:38:41,718 --> 00:38:45,141
increase, well we're trying to send more blood to the tissues,

303
00:38:46,142 --> 00:38:50,467
or we just talked about maybe we're trying to send more blood to different areas to dissipate heat.

304
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:55,818
But if we're primarily sending most of that blood to the muscles,

305
00:38:55,818 --> 00:39:02,086
It's just a product of how can I get a certain flow of blood to the muscles.

306
00:39:03,067 --> 00:39:08,313
We can do that in a variety of different ways, and that changes depending on the individual.

307
00:39:09,395 --> 00:39:11,277
Some individuals are larger than others.

308
00:39:11,277 --> 00:39:13,200
Some individuals have larger hearts than others.

309
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,003
Some individuals have more or less blood.

310
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:20,831
So here's the comparison of heart rate, stroke volume, and

311
00:39:20,831 --> 00:39:25,520
cardiac output between men and women at the same absolute and relative power output.

312
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,707
So over here, we're at the same absolute power.

313
00:39:28,707 --> 00:39:33,757
So at 50 watts here, if we're looking at heart rate and stroke volume over here.

314
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,102
So heart rate.

315
00:39:36,925 --> 00:39:43,392
Men typically have a lower heart rate compared to women at the exact same absolute power,

316
00:39:44,212 --> 00:39:47,676
but if they're both at 60% of their VO2 max, so

317
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:51,220
relative intensity, they will have the exact same heart rate.

318
00:39:52,461 --> 00:39:56,225
It's possible most of the time at the same relative

319
00:39:56,225 --> 00:40:01,330
intensity, though, if we're looking at a bike, men typically are just at a higher power output.

320
00:40:05,731 --> 00:40:09,317
And a lot of this can be kind of overall.

321
00:40:10,279 --> 00:40:13,304
We can see that from this cardiac output over here

322
00:40:13,304 --> 00:40:17,691
because they do have a higher cardiac output because they have a higher stroke volume.

323
00:40:17,691 --> 00:40:23,481
So they're just sending more blood overall to the muscles because they're doing a higher power.

324
00:40:24,402 --> 00:40:30,152
And when you have a higher power, you need more oxygen to create energy to do the work.

325
00:40:36,224 --> 00:40:37,086
Any questions here?

326
00:40:41,354 --> 00:40:41,434
OK.

327
00:40:41,434 --> 00:40:43,558
Next topic will be heart rate variability.

328
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,147
You've probably seen this quite often by now.

329
00:40:48,147 --> 00:40:52,936
A lot of these personal devices have heart rate variability,

330
00:40:52,936 --> 00:40:54,840
whether it's your watch or maybe your phone.

331
00:40:55,641 --> 00:40:58,266
They usually have this measure.

332
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,486
but today we're gonna learn about what it actually is.

333
00:41:01,486 --> 00:41:05,471
So this is the variation in time between each heartbeat.

334
00:41:06,492 --> 00:41:09,456
So every time you have a contraction, kind of this

335
00:41:09,456 --> 00:41:15,263
QRST complex here, we're looking at the time between each one of these.

336
00:41:19,729 --> 00:41:24,034
If we're looking at the QRST complex, it's measuring from the R to the R.

337
00:41:27,322 --> 00:41:31,428
And we need EKG or ECG tracing in order to do this.

338
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:42,084
Okay, so if we have wide variation between resting

339
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:46,871
heart rate variability, this is a good indication that this

340
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:54,021
individual is probably a little bit more healthy compared to an individual who has low variation.

341
00:41:55,064 --> 00:41:58,950
So when we say wide variation, we're saying the time between

342
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:06,140
each R to R complex on the EKG is variable.

343
00:42:06,981 --> 00:42:10,526
So maybe the first one's .93 seconds before the next

344
00:42:10,526 --> 00:42:17,336
heartbeat, and then .98 before the next heartbeat, and then 1.2 before the next one, and then 1.3.

345
00:42:19,158 --> 00:42:24,393
This wide variation, again, is a good sign

346
00:42:24,393 --> 00:42:27,718
of a maybe healthy or healthier individual.

347
00:42:31,704 --> 00:42:37,433
Low variation means that you have the same time between each beat.

348
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:44,123
This should make a little bit of sense because the only

349
00:42:44,123 --> 00:42:50,768
way I can have low variation or very similar time frame between each beat

350
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:55,114
is if I'm having more influence from the sympathetic nervous system.

351
00:42:56,897 --> 00:43:02,164
Because the sympathetic nervous system is driving that heart rate.

352
00:43:03,787 --> 00:43:05,589
That is not necessarily a good thing.

353
00:43:07,192 --> 00:43:11,938
We don't want our sympathetic nervous system driving our heart rate at rest.

354
00:43:13,721 --> 00:43:18,038
We want the parasympathetic nervous system driving that.

355
00:43:18,038 --> 00:43:20,703
And when the parasympathetic nervous system is really driving

356
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:23,489
the resting heart rate, there's more variability.

357
00:43:23,489 --> 00:43:27,156
Because there's no direct signal to say, beat, right?

358
00:43:27,156 --> 00:43:28,037
Have a contraction.

359
00:43:28,037 --> 00:43:31,464
Have a contraction.

360
00:43:31,464 --> 00:43:35,200
And if you think about it, individuals who are a little bit more stressed,

361
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,124
Maybe their epinephrine's a little bit high, right?

362
00:43:38,124 --> 00:43:42,830
Those are influences where you're increasing the activity of the sympathetic nervous system.

363
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:49,418
And that's generally a sign, or maybe a risk factor for mortality.

364
00:43:51,942 --> 00:43:55,747
So there are diseases that promote a decrease in heart rate variability.

365
00:43:55,747 --> 00:43:57,248
So again, that's not a great thing.

366
00:43:57,248 --> 00:44:00,913
So depression, hypertension, heart disease, physical inactivity.

367
00:44:02,736 --> 00:44:03,857
There are a lot of,

368
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,704
I guess investigations or research projects or groups that are

369
00:44:08,704 --> 00:44:14,990
looking at how we can use heart rate variability with specific training programs.

370
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:22,097
So sometimes an individual or a company would say, okay, if you have a wide variation,

371
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:29,044
maybe you are a little bit more rested compared to

372
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:33,068
if you're just having sympathetic input into the heart.

373
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:38,436
Now, there are a lot of different factors that are influencing that.

374
00:44:38,436 --> 00:44:44,643
And so this still isn't a really great indicator of how well rested someone might be.

375
00:44:53,934 --> 00:44:54,014
OK.

376
00:44:54,014 --> 00:44:56,858
So that's regulation of heart rate.

377
00:45:00,682 --> 00:45:04,827
Let's move to the regulation of stroke volume.

378
00:45:08,114 --> 00:45:12,638
Three major factors that we're gonna talk about that regulate stroke volume.

379
00:45:12,638 --> 00:45:15,401
We're gonna start with end diastolic volume.

380
00:45:15,401 --> 00:45:16,001
That's number one.

381
00:45:17,823 --> 00:45:24,289
As a reminder, end diastolic volume is the volume in the ventricles at the end of diastole.

382
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:27,632
This is sometimes referred to as preload.

383
00:45:30,055 --> 00:45:37,682
So how much blood is in the ventricle before you undergo a contraction?

384
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:43,615
This is another figure depicting the same thing.

385
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:48,300
So there's less preload here because there's less blood in the ventricles.

386
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,844
There's more preload here because there's more blood in the ventricles.

387
00:45:53,185 --> 00:45:56,469
If I have more blood in the ventricles and I have

388
00:45:56,469 --> 00:46:01,154
a contraction, well that means more blood is going to leave the heart.

389
00:46:02,996 --> 00:46:06,640
So that in itself is going to regulate stroke volume.

390
00:46:11,547 --> 00:46:13,790
Okay, now let's bring back, so if we're talking about

391
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:17,095
end diastolic volume, we have to bring back the pressure volume loop.

392
00:46:18,897 --> 00:46:21,320
Here's the pressure volume loop.

393
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:26,788
Keep in mind that an increase in end diastolic volume will increase stroke volume.

394
00:46:29,432 --> 00:46:34,078
Again, the y-axis here is pressure, x-axis is volume.

395
00:46:35,223 --> 00:46:39,888
The way you wanna start with these graphs would be look at the control.

396
00:46:39,888 --> 00:46:43,231
So this is the dotted black line here.

397
00:46:45,253 --> 00:46:46,414
So we're starting here.

398
00:46:49,257 --> 00:46:59,168
If I increase preload or end diastolic volume, which direction am I going on this graph?

399
00:46:59,168 --> 00:47:04,453
Yeah, to the right because we're increasing the volume inside of the ventricles.

400
00:47:05,294 --> 00:47:09,660
So we actually push the right side of the curve to the right.

401
00:47:12,344 --> 00:47:16,710
Then you undergo the same increase in pressure, volume

402
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:22,337
leaves the ventricles, and then the end kind of systolic volume

403
00:47:22,337 --> 00:47:25,862
doesn't change, and it fills back up to the original amount.

404
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:32,331
This delta here shows us there's an increase in stroke volume.

405
00:47:34,454 --> 00:47:35,495
You could go the other way.

406
00:47:35,495 --> 00:47:38,078
So if this is control, this is normal.

407
00:47:38,078 --> 00:47:43,705
If I have a decrease in end diastolic volume, then I go to the left here.

408
00:47:43,705 --> 00:47:46,668
So maybe I'm going from 125 to 100.

409
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:51,934
Well, now this delta here is much lower than control.

410
00:47:55,118 --> 00:48:00,664
Notice that the pressure changes are about the same.

411
00:48:02,028 --> 00:48:05,452
The only thing that is changing is the end diastolic

412
00:48:05,452 --> 00:48:09,577
volume because that's what we are talking about right now, end diastolic volume.

413
00:48:19,168 --> 00:48:22,672
Okay, so then sometimes we're thinking about, well, how do

414
00:48:22,672 --> 00:48:27,897
I get more blood into the ventricles or less blood into the ventricles?

415
00:48:27,897 --> 00:48:30,621
Well, one of the best mechanisms to increase end

416
00:48:30,621 --> 00:48:34,466
diastolic volume is something called the Frank Starling's mechanism.

417
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:43,018
If I have a contraction, that contraction in itself is gonna

418
00:48:43,018 --> 00:48:48,785
cause blood to move to the rest of the system, but it's also gonna cause more blood to come back.

419
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:55,795
So a greater end diastolic volume results in a more forceful contraction in itself.

420
00:48:57,158 --> 00:49:00,583
Once you bring more blood back into it, the ventricles

421
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:04,549
start to stretch into a more optimal overlap and then you

422
00:49:04,549 --> 00:49:07,974
have a stronger contraction on the next round and then more

423
00:49:07,974 --> 00:49:10,578
blood coming into the ventricles and then they stretch even more.

424
00:49:12,581 --> 00:49:14,744
So this is dependent on that venous return.

425
00:49:19,351 --> 00:49:22,876
So if we have this normal resting value, an increase

426
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:26,642
in venous return is going to increase stroke volume just like what we talked about.

427
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:35,691
So not necessarily just because the way the ventricles

428
00:49:35,691 --> 00:49:39,259
are positioned that every time you stretch it even more, it's

429
00:49:39,259 --> 00:49:43,588
always going to be in the most kind of optimal overlap.

430
00:49:43,588 --> 00:49:45,877
There are some issues with

431
00:49:45,877 --> 00:49:49,341
We don't have to go down this route, but you sometimes

432
00:49:49,341 --> 00:49:52,645
they do this with like race horses or ponies, but they remove

433
00:49:52,645 --> 00:49:56,790
the sheathing on the outside of the heart so you can have even more expansion.

434
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:01,155
And that's how they can get some crazy performance out of like ponies and horses.

435
00:50:02,076 --> 00:50:08,984
But then the flip side to that is if you go too much, then you can rupture some of the ventricles.

436
00:50:08,984 --> 00:50:10,065
That becomes a problem.

437
00:50:10,065 --> 00:50:11,227
And that has happened.

438
00:50:11,227 --> 00:50:11,547
So, yeah.

439
00:50:16,268 --> 00:50:26,342
OK, so then if we're on this piece, we can also think

440
00:50:26,342 --> 00:50:33,272
about if all of this is dependent on venous return, what other factors can influence venous return?

441
00:50:36,497 --> 00:50:40,723
Well, end diastolic volume and venous return, we're going

442
00:50:40,723 --> 00:50:44,489
to talk about three major factors that influence venous return.

443
00:50:44,489 --> 00:50:46,191
One would be venal constriction.

444
00:50:47,403 --> 00:50:51,107
We typically don't think about the veins being able to be too malleable

445
00:50:51,107 --> 00:50:57,035
as far as vasodilation or vasoconstriction, but this venoconstriction

446
00:50:57,035 --> 00:51:00,979
does happen in a very small magnitude via the sympathetic nervous system.

447
00:51:05,505 --> 00:51:10,311
And that's really, you're kind of getting some contraction with those smooth muscles in the veins.

448
00:51:12,553 --> 00:51:16,498
If that happens, you can help accelerate or increase the venous return.

449
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:21,313
Number two, skeletal muscle pump.

450
00:51:24,959 --> 00:51:30,407
So with your veins, they have some pretty nice

451
00:51:30,407 --> 00:51:38,332
little anatomical adaptations where they have one-way valves that prevent the backflow of veins.

452
00:51:38,332 --> 00:51:42,356
So you can think of it as like if you just had a hose full of water and you just squeeze on

453
00:51:42,356 --> 00:51:46,381
that hose, well, blood's gonna, or water's gonna move up,

454
00:51:46,381 --> 00:51:49,564
but if it goes through a one-way valve, it can never come back down.

455
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:54,329
And so the muscles are almost like squeezing the veins to

456
00:51:54,329 --> 00:52:00,856
get the blood to move back up towards the heart.

457
00:52:00,856 --> 00:52:06,479
So as soon as you squeeze that vein and you let it go, now you have a delta in pressure.

458
00:52:06,479 --> 00:52:10,145
There's high pressure below, low pressure here, and you're always gonna get it to move.

459
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:13,970
Okay.

460
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:17,235
Oh, this is another artist rendering, right?

461
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:20,120
If I squeeze onto here, you're gonna get the blood to

462
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:25,288
move back towards the heart, but it's not gonna go back downwards because of these one-way valves.

463
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:29,194
And as soon as this opens back up, well, that

464
00:52:30,155 --> 00:52:35,423
change in pressure is gonna automatically increase the flow back into this area.

465
00:52:36,247 --> 00:52:38,591
because you want to go from a higher pressure to a lower pressure.

466
00:52:38,591 --> 00:52:41,335
So as soon as that muscle relaxes, you can have blood

467
00:52:41,335 --> 00:52:47,264
rush in and then the muscle contracts and you're helping move the blood down or up towards the heart.

468
00:52:49,508 --> 00:52:52,593
Okay, the third factor would be the respiratory pump.

469
00:52:54,596 --> 00:52:59,203
If you have changes in thoracic pressure, that also influences

470
00:52:59,203 --> 00:53:01,647
blood to kind of return towards the heart.

471
00:53:04,428 --> 00:53:11,275
This would be kind of a good, I guess, figure to look at where you have a couple things.

472
00:53:11,275 --> 00:53:14,438
One, you can have compression of these, but

473
00:53:14,438 --> 00:53:19,704
you're actually decreasing over here the intra-thoracic pressure, which

474
00:53:19,704 --> 00:53:23,127
is going to influence blood to try to come back up.

475
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:31,836
When you exhale, that's going to encourage the blood kind of coming from the top end back down.

476
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:39,667
Same concept as the skeletal muscle pump, but it's

477
00:53:39,667 --> 00:53:45,856
happening through ventilation and changes in pressure in the thoracic cavity.

478
00:53:49,081 --> 00:53:51,725
So two different mechanisms, but they end in the same

479
00:53:51,725 --> 00:53:55,090
goal, which is returning venous blood back to the heart.

480
00:54:03,068 --> 00:54:05,551
Okay, filling time.

481
00:54:05,551 --> 00:54:07,854
This is another piece that we need to be careful about.

482
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:14,061
There's only a certain amount of time that you have to

483
00:54:14,061 --> 00:54:17,606
fill the ventricle before it goes ahead and contracts on the

484
00:54:17,606 --> 00:54:21,010
next one and moves the blood out of the ventricle.

485
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:24,994
So we have to talk about filling time here.

486
00:54:24,994 --> 00:54:32,313
So if we're at rest, a lot of the times moving through these different

487
00:54:32,313 --> 00:54:36,968
Heart rates, we don't get too much of a delta

488
00:54:36,968 --> 00:54:42,525
in this left ventricle and diastolic volume compared to athletes here.

489
00:54:48,395 --> 00:54:50,077
One of the biggest things that we need to be

490
00:54:50,077 --> 00:54:54,041
careful about is thinking about what's causing the decrease in

491
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:59,086
filling time towards the end of this area for the athletes here.

492
00:54:59,086 --> 00:55:03,531
So we get an increase, an increase, but then we get a dip back down.

493
00:55:04,692 --> 00:55:08,316
This happens in both groups, but it seems like there's a larger magnitude up here.

494
00:55:10,338 --> 00:55:14,082
And this is that concept where the heart is beating too fast,

495
00:55:15,091 --> 00:55:20,297
and it's not allowing for enough fluid or blood to get back into the ventricle.

496
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:26,824
So before you can have that optimal filling time, the heart contracts.

497
00:55:28,286 --> 00:55:33,051
So that's why we see this dip here in the left ventricle and diastolic volume.

498
00:55:37,637 --> 00:55:39,799
Number two would be body position.

499
00:55:41,382 --> 00:55:45,949
So body position does influence the return or the filling time.

500
00:55:48,112 --> 00:55:53,500
If we're all standing up, gravity is kind of pulling the

501
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:57,466
blood down into our feet, as opposed to if you were to

502
00:55:57,466 --> 00:56:04,897
lay flat, the blood kind of evenly distributes to the rest of the body.

503
00:56:04,897 --> 00:56:08,082
And so you don't really have to fight bringing this blood back up to the heart.

504
00:56:12,584 --> 00:56:18,772
So this is actually a pretty big issue when there are studies looking at microgravity.

505
00:56:20,514 --> 00:56:26,301
So if you have someone laying down or even in space,

506
00:56:26,301 --> 00:56:30,026
you actually get all the blood to kind of come closer

507
00:56:30,026 --> 00:56:33,550
up towards the top and you increase central venous pressure.

508
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:36,254
And that's why a lot of times astronauts have a lot

509
00:56:36,254 --> 00:56:41,140
of trouble with too much ocular pressure or just higher blood pressure in general.

510
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:48,174
So this figure or this concept actually reminds me like, it was a long time ago,

511
00:56:48,174 --> 00:56:50,578
but one of the first studies that I was involved with

512
00:56:50,578 --> 00:56:56,608
was a NACID fundus study where we did head down bed tilt.

513
00:56:56,608 --> 00:56:59,773
So you're simulating microgravity.

514
00:56:59,773 --> 00:57:04,641
And you have the bed tilted down, and you have someone's head over here and their feet up here.

515
00:57:04,641 --> 00:57:07,630
And we left them there for four days straight.

516
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:13,858
I know it's very uncomfortable, but it simulates microgravity that you would have in space.

517
00:57:13,858 --> 00:57:16,301
And you actually, because of the increase in central

518
00:57:16,301 --> 00:57:20,947
venous blood pressure, your body starts getting rid of blood.

519
00:57:20,947 --> 00:57:24,031
Because it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, this is way too much.

520
00:57:24,031 --> 00:57:26,194
And you start kind of taking away some of the red

521
00:57:26,194 --> 00:57:31,141
blood cells and decreasing blood volume to deal with that increase in central venous pressure.

522
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:34,465
OK.

523
00:57:37,752 --> 00:57:41,335
They were compensated quite well monetarily.

524
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:48,802
Regulation of stroke volume, we just talked about this already.

525
00:57:48,802 --> 00:57:54,087
Average aortic blood pressure.

526
00:57:56,429 --> 00:58:01,073
So this is the pressure that the ventricles must pump against to eject blood.

527
00:58:02,535 --> 00:58:06,038
This is also sometimes called afterload.

528
00:58:08,195 --> 00:58:10,298
This is the mean arterial pressure.

529
00:58:13,602 --> 00:58:16,967
So if we use that same example when you squeeze a vein

530
00:58:16,967 --> 00:58:25,699
and the blood is moving back up to the heart, well as soon as you relax, where does the blood want to go?

531
00:58:25,699 --> 00:58:27,080
It wants to go back down.

532
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,683
So it's pressing on that valve.

533
00:58:29,684 --> 00:58:31,106
So it's the same thing in the heart.

534
00:58:31,106 --> 00:58:34,991
When your ventricle moves blood outside of the heart, well

535
00:58:34,991 --> 00:58:37,915
there's still blood in the aorta trying to get back in.

536
00:58:39,177 --> 00:58:44,906
This kind of back-in pressure, or the mean arterial pressure, the blood pressure in the body,

537
00:58:44,906 --> 00:58:48,011
is what you have to overcome to open that aortic valve to

538
00:58:48,011 --> 00:58:51,817
get the next kind of flow of blood out of the heart.

539
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:55,262
So that's what this average aortic pressure is.

540
00:58:56,930 --> 00:59:00,694
So this figure here, what it's basically trying to depict is

541
00:59:00,694 --> 00:59:07,723
on the aortic arch or kind of after you move blood

542
00:59:07,723 --> 00:59:11,747
out of the ventricles, you're getting an increase in pressure here.

543
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:16,273
If you have an increase in this afterload or the pressure

544
00:59:16,273 --> 00:59:21,078
coming back in to the heart, you almost have to overcome that, right?

545
00:59:21,078 --> 00:59:25,063
So then you have to supply more pressure.

546
00:59:27,575 --> 00:59:31,499
Stroke volume is inversely proportional to the afterload.

547
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:38,886
If there's too much pressure coming back into the heart, you now don't have enough time

548
00:59:38,886 --> 00:59:42,010
or you don't have as large of a stroke volume

549
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:47,075
because of that extra pressure coming back in because it's encouraging those valves to close.

550
00:59:49,117 --> 00:59:54,473
So a decrease in afterload is going to increase stroke volume.

551
00:59:54,473 --> 00:59:58,900
and vice versa, an increase in afterload is going to decrease stroke volume.

552
01:00:00,342 --> 01:00:03,066
The way to look at this figure would be, so on the Y

553
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:08,074
axis we have stroke volume, on the X axis we have basically pressure.

554
01:00:09,376 --> 01:00:13,762
If I have an increase in afterload here, I have to

555
01:00:13,762 --> 01:00:20,312
generate more pressure in order to get the same amount of blood flow.

556
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:31,018
So that means to get more, then you basically have

557
01:00:31,018 --> 01:00:36,103
less stroke volume with an increase in afterlife.

558
01:00:36,103 --> 01:00:38,285
So here's the normal graph you wanna start here.

559
01:00:39,847 --> 01:00:42,830
And if you decrease the pressure coming back into the

560
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:46,153
heart, then you're gonna get a higher stroke volume.

561
01:00:47,754 --> 01:00:51,598
If I increase the pressure going this way,

562
01:00:52,827 --> 01:00:56,114
then now you're at a lower stroke volume compared to

563
01:00:56,114 --> 01:00:58,880
normal and compared to a decrease in afterload.

564
01:01:04,832 --> 01:01:06,736
If you don't like this figure, that's OK, because

565
01:01:06,736 --> 01:01:10,484
we're primarily working with the pressure volume loop.

566
01:01:10,484 --> 01:01:12,388
So here on the afterload,

567
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:17,734
If you remember, from end diastolic volume, we are

568
01:01:17,734 --> 01:01:22,440
shifting this side, while for afterload, we're shifting the left side.

569
01:01:23,642 --> 01:01:27,306
So remember, we wanna start with this center dotted curve here.

570
01:01:27,306 --> 01:01:37,138
If I have to overcome some amount of pressure

571
01:01:37,138 --> 01:01:42,865
over here, because there's increasing pressure coming back to the heart,

572
01:01:45,106 --> 01:01:47,228
I would have to go, so I'm on the red curve right now.

573
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:50,151
There's so much pressure on the valve, I'm

574
01:01:50,151 --> 01:01:52,594
increasing pressure, I'm increasing pressure, I'm increasing

575
01:01:52,594 --> 01:01:56,198
pressure, still increasing pressure, still increasing pressure.

576
01:01:56,198 --> 01:02:00,943
Finally, I've generated enough pressure to open the aortic valve.

577
01:02:02,665 --> 01:02:06,549
Then I move blood out of the heart, but by that

578
01:02:06,549 --> 01:02:11,434
time, the pressure's coming back to close the aortic valve, so we're

579
01:02:11,434 --> 01:02:14,337
not able to move as much blood out of the ventricle.

580
01:02:15,413 --> 01:02:17,961
So the delta here is now much lower.

581
01:02:21,933 --> 01:02:27,985
If I decrease the pressure on the outside of the ventricles coming back in,

582
01:02:27,985 --> 01:02:32,252
Well now I don't have to generate as much pressure to open those valves.

583
01:02:32,252 --> 01:02:36,459
So I'm on the green curve now, so I'm generating pressure, going up the graph here,

584
01:02:36,459 --> 01:02:41,107
generating pressure, generating pressure, and then now the valve's open,

585
01:02:41,908 --> 01:02:44,773
and all of a sudden I'm moving more blood out of

586
01:02:44,773 --> 01:02:48,278
the heart because there's less pressure to close the valves coming back in.

587
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:51,664
And so now my end systolic volume

588
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:57,393
is much lower at the same end diastolic volume would

589
01:02:57,393 --> 01:03:00,277
give you a larger stroke volume, this delta here.

590
01:03:01,479 --> 01:03:11,172
Yeah.

591
01:03:11,172 --> 01:03:11,753
That is correct.

592
01:03:12,834 --> 01:03:14,176
Yeah.

593
01:03:15,899 --> 01:03:18,843
You can almost think about it like a, I don't know, a door or something like that.

594
01:03:18,843 --> 01:03:21,125
If someone's on the back of the door,

595
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:25,129
like preventing you from opening the door, you have to push

596
01:03:25,129 --> 01:03:27,211
or generate a lot of force to open the door.

597
01:03:28,392 --> 01:03:30,755
But eventually, if you start to relax, it's gonna be a

598
01:03:30,755 --> 01:03:35,119
lot easier to close that door so the valves don't stay open as long.

599
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:39,043
So that's why you only get to move a small amount of blood here.

600
01:03:41,285 --> 01:03:43,648
Whereas if the door was pretty easy to open, maybe you can

601
01:03:43,648 --> 01:03:49,714
open it all the way and then you can get more blood out of the heart before the next relaxation.

602
01:03:56,073 --> 01:03:57,215
Okay, so that's after load.

603
01:03:59,299 --> 01:04:04,770
Number three would be the strength of the ventricular contraction.

604
01:04:06,073 --> 01:04:08,798
We call that inotropy.

605
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:13,267
So that's this piece here.

606
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:17,355
This is enhanced by circulating epinephrine and norepinephrine.

607
01:04:18,787 --> 01:04:22,273
Because if you remember, those beta adrenergic receptors

608
01:04:22,273 --> 01:04:27,040
are accepting epinephrine and that's gonna cause the cell to depolarize.

609
01:04:29,564 --> 01:04:32,769
We also get the direct sympathetic stimulation of the

610
01:04:32,769 --> 01:04:38,619
heart and those are via the cardiac accelerator nerves that we saw on this graph here.

611
01:04:38,619 --> 01:04:39,580
So it's this right here.

612
01:04:46,141 --> 01:04:52,069
And then just as a reminder, if I have circulating epinephrine, these receptors are not selective.

613
01:04:52,069 --> 01:04:54,373
They don't care where the epinephrine came from.

614
01:04:54,373 --> 01:04:57,757
If the epinephrine or epinephrine binds to this receptor,

615
01:04:57,757 --> 01:05:01,202
it's going to cause a depolarization in the cell.

616
01:05:05,548 --> 01:05:10,516
So more inotropy would be more epinephrine binding onto

617
01:05:10,516 --> 01:05:15,102
the beta adrenergic receptors, causing a more forceful contraction.

618
01:05:18,035 --> 01:05:24,063
less epineurothrin or less inotropy, well, you're just activating less muscle fibers.

619
01:05:28,108 --> 01:05:32,874
So sometimes you can think of it like if you have a towel

620
01:05:32,874 --> 01:05:37,481
that you put in water or a shirt and the heart kind of twists.

621
01:05:37,481 --> 01:05:40,883
So if you wring the towel just a little bit,

622
01:05:40,883 --> 01:05:42,885
Well, that's only a little bit of water that's gonna come out.

623
01:05:42,885 --> 01:05:45,988
But if you wring the towel a lot more, then more water comes out.

624
01:05:45,988 --> 01:05:47,309
And that's essentially what you're doing here.

625
01:05:47,309 --> 01:05:49,571
If you can activate more muscle fibers and get that

626
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:52,994
twisting motion of the heart, it's going to help move blood out.

627
01:05:55,877 --> 01:06:00,461
Okay, so the increase in inotropy is going to increase stroke volume.

628
01:06:07,127 --> 01:06:10,570
Let's bring it back to the pressure volume loop here.

629
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:17,546
So end isolic volume, we moved this way.

630
01:06:17,546 --> 01:06:22,171
Pressure, we're having to generate more pressure on the up, on the Y axis.

631
01:06:23,192 --> 01:06:25,974
End systolic volume here is over here.

632
01:06:27,296 --> 01:06:32,020
So here we have the black curve to start with, or the black dotted curve here to start with.

633
01:06:33,982 --> 01:06:40,168
If I have an increase, or the more forceful contraction,

634
01:06:41,296 --> 01:06:46,724
then you will by default cause more blood to move outside

635
01:06:46,724 --> 01:06:51,250
of the heart, and then you would have an end systolic volume that is lower.

636
01:06:52,192 --> 01:06:56,598
And so now the delta for an increase in inotropy is

637
01:06:56,598 --> 01:06:59,983
going to result in an increase in stroke volume.

638
01:07:01,525 --> 01:07:07,033
A decrease in the inotropy is gonna cause a decrease in the stroke volume.

639
01:07:09,427 --> 01:07:11,912
So the best way to try to, like, if you

640
01:07:11,912 --> 01:07:17,342
saw a pressure-volume loop with those three scenarios, well, if

641
01:07:17,342 --> 01:07:25,758
they're at the same pressure, then we know we're not really dealing with afterload.

642
01:07:25,758 --> 01:07:30,827
And we're dealing with this piece here, inotropy, or the strength of the contraction.

643
01:07:39,025 --> 01:07:39,606
Questions?

644
01:07:43,594 --> 01:07:46,740
Okay, regulation of stroke volume goes back to this piece.

645
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:49,144
We pretty much talked about all of them,

646
01:07:49,144 --> 01:07:54,114
endostalic volume, increasing contractility or the inotropy, and

647
01:07:54,114 --> 01:07:57,140
then the decrease in arterial pressure or the afterload.

648
01:07:57,140 --> 01:08:00,426
Those all are going to influence stroke volume.

649
01:08:01,992 --> 01:08:07,260
Keep in mind the venous return is really gonna be influencing the end-diastolic volume.

650
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:11,126
Sympathetic or epinephrine is going to be increasing the

651
01:08:11,126 --> 01:08:14,432
inotropy or the contractility of the heart.

652
01:08:14,432 --> 01:08:17,577
Afterload is really dependent on that mean arterial pressure

653
01:08:17,577 --> 01:08:20,501
or the pressure kind of being exerted back onto the heart.

654
01:08:23,826 --> 01:08:28,033
Okay, so we talked about these three kind of pressure-volume loops separately.

655
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:31,407
But that doesn't happen, right?

656
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:36,935
Like we don't just see one thing changing, all three are kind of happening at the same time.

657
01:08:38,397 --> 01:08:41,781
So the regulation of stroke volume during exercise is due

658
01:08:41,781 --> 01:08:46,127
to all three of these factors, but the overall theme is that

659
01:08:46,127 --> 01:08:50,393
we do see an increase in stroke volume from rest to maximal exercise.

660
01:08:53,191 --> 01:08:57,599
We primarily have the increase in diastolic volume, which is that preload,

661
01:08:57,599 --> 01:09:01,666
and we eventually always get that increase in inotropy,

662
01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:05,692
especially when we're kind of beyond that 100 beats per minute, right?

663
01:09:05,692 --> 01:09:10,781
Because underneath 100 beats per minute, that's primarily through parasympathetic withdrawal.

664
01:09:10,781 --> 01:09:13,927
And then once we start getting into higher intensities,

665
01:09:13,927 --> 01:09:17,072
it's primarily due to that sympathetic outflow.

666
01:09:23,853 --> 01:09:31,003
You already know this, but sometimes it's nice to see all of these factors kind of tying in.

667
01:09:31,003 --> 01:09:36,251
When you're looking at this figure, the dotted line is inhibition.

668
01:09:36,251 --> 01:09:40,317
The parasympathetic nerves are inhibiting the cardiac rate or the heart rate.

669
01:09:41,438 --> 01:09:45,825
Sympathetic nerves are increasing heart rate, so that's why you see a solid line here.

670
01:09:46,886 --> 01:09:50,151
Mean arterial pressure is not necessarily inhibiting, but it

671
01:09:50,151 --> 01:09:52,915
is decreasing your stroke volume over here.

672
01:09:56,843 --> 01:10:09,086
And then of course, don't forget about the Frank Sterling law over here as well.

673
01:10:09,086 --> 01:10:10,168
How are we doing?

674
01:10:10,168 --> 01:10:10,689
Is that a lot?

675
01:10:12,212 --> 01:10:13,153
Maybe we can keep going.

676
01:10:14,175 --> 01:10:14,356
No.

677
01:10:15,538 --> 01:10:16,600
All right, that's fine.

678
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:17,542
Have a good weekend.

679
01:10:17,542 --> 01:10:19,425
Enjoy, enjoy.
