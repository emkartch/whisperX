1
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,071
All right, cool.

2
00:03:21,678 --> 00:03:23,700
Okay, welcome back everyone.

3
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:26,744
Good to see you.

4
00:03:26,744 --> 00:03:30,970
I have a few announcements before we get started.

5
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:38,700
Number one, I know we can probably get to chapters 12, 13, and 15.

6
00:03:39,777 --> 00:03:41,940
But I didn't want to rush things.

7
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:49,492
So I don't know if you noticed, on Canvas, I push all of those slide decks to the final exam.

8
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:52,357
It doesn't mean you're really getting too much more on

9
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:57,425
the final exam because we'll have some guest lectures and some special topics and things like that.

10
00:03:57,425 --> 00:04:02,457
So don't worry that we're overloading the final exam.

11
00:04:02,457 --> 00:04:05,608
I think we'll be OK with this, having a little bit

12
00:04:05,608 --> 00:04:09,803
less material to worry about in this short period of time before spring break.

13
00:04:10,686 --> 00:04:14,354
So we're really just focusing on

14
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,719
chapters 8, 9, 10, and 11.

15
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:20,763
That way we can kind of take our time with these

16
00:04:20,763 --> 00:04:25,869
and make sure we're really focusing on these last two slide

17
00:04:25,869 --> 00:04:31,096
decks as opposed to trying to worry about that physiology of

18
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:36,784
training, which is actually a decent number of slides.

19
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:42,829
I believe I updated the syllabus, the calendar on that to reflect it,

20
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:47,274
but just know for exam two, lecture exam two, we're

21
00:04:47,274 --> 00:04:52,901
just focusing on what's on that Canvas module all the way up to chapter 11.

22
00:04:54,903 --> 00:04:55,764
Any questions on that?

23
00:04:58,487 --> 00:05:00,670
Okay.

24
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:02,552
When is that exam?

25
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:05,817
two weeks from today.

26
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:08,180
So it's coming up pretty quick.

27
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,845
The nice thing is you'll just get that out of the way

28
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:18,034
and you can enjoy spring break and then come back for that last leg before we take the final.

29
00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:21,331
So you're pretty much through the...

30
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:26,237
The bulk of things, we got your first lecture exam, you got your first lab exam in the books.

31
00:05:27,178 --> 00:05:30,902
Next week during your lab, at the end of each lab,

32
00:05:30,902 --> 00:05:36,068
we'll hand back your lab exams and you'll see, you'll get to

33
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:39,953
review your lab exam and then you can ask any questions to the TA.

34
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:44,358
And then we can meet again later if you have any other questions.

35
00:05:47,802 --> 00:05:48,042
All right.

36
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:49,043
Okay, so.

37
00:05:50,002 --> 00:05:53,769
We'll move on here to respiration during exercise.

38
00:05:58,117 --> 00:05:59,379
Here's the general outline.

39
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:02,044
We're going to start with the mechanics of breathing.

40
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:04,227
So we need to talk about

41
00:06:04,227 --> 00:06:08,915
Just a few things to make sure we're on the same page with the mechanics of breathing.

42
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:11,540
Then we'll talk about pulmonary ventilation.

43
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,226
Then the control of ventilation at rest and during exercise.

44
00:06:15,226 --> 00:06:18,132
So this is almost like the why and this is the how.

45
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:21,895
And then blood flow to the lungs.

46
00:06:21,895 --> 00:06:26,860
We kind of touched on this already with Harms' work, but we'll touch on it a little bit more.

47
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,665
Ventilation-perfusion relationships, so this is pretty important, especially

48
00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:37,751
if we're trying to take these concepts to, say, different environmental settings like altitude.

49
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:42,235
Then the O2 transport in the blood and muscle, CO2

50
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:47,377
transport in the blood, and does the pulmonary system limit exercise performance?

51
00:06:47,377 --> 00:06:52,183
So there's this idea that, in general, our lungs are a little bit overbuilt.

52
00:06:52,183 --> 00:06:54,535
But we'll take a look into that concept.

53
00:06:56,962 --> 00:06:58,904
OK, so let's start with a brief introduction.

54
00:06:58,904 --> 00:07:01,928
I think we know all about pulmonary ventilation.

55
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:03,790
But here it is.

56
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,752
Ventilation is just breathing.

57
00:07:05,752 --> 00:07:10,017
And we're just exchanging different gases.

58
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:13,421
We're primarily concerned about oxygen and CO2.

59
00:07:13,421 --> 00:07:18,987
And so that's why a lot of the times it's just labeled as the exchange of O2 and CO2 in the lungs.

60
00:07:20,215 --> 00:07:25,502
Cellular respiration, on the other hand, well, this is happening at the tissues, right?

61
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:31,349
At the cells themselves, they are also kind of exchanging or moving oxygen

62
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:35,214
and CO2 in different ways because it's utilizing the

63
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:39,439
oxygen in order to undergo oxidative phosphorylation and then

64
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:45,126
producing CO2 once you start breaking down some of those carbon chains in the Krebs cycle.

65
00:07:51,248 --> 00:07:54,212
Okay, so the overall broad purpose then of the

66
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:59,941
respiratory system during exercise is just moving the air from the outside into your body.

67
00:08:02,925 --> 00:08:07,612
The other piece that we sometimes forget about is we also

68
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:13,060
try to exhale some molecules in order to really regulate

69
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:20,310
acid-base balance during times of maybe large pH changes.

70
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:25,250
Typically, that happens during exercise, but you could imagine

71
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,114
that can happen in a variety of different situations, not during exercise.

72
00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:33,879
But since we're an exercise physiology course, we're gonna focus on the during exercise here.

73
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:42,628
Okay, mechanics of breathing, pretty straightforward, ventilation, moving air.

74
00:08:42,628 --> 00:08:44,450
We really do that by bulk flow.

75
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,893
We need some type of pressure differential.

76
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:54,542
If we can get low pressure inside of the lungs, the air will just move into the lungs.

77
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:57,887
If we can increase the pressure into the lungs more

78
00:08:57,887 --> 00:09:01,333
than the pressure in the environment, then the air will leave our lungs.

79
00:09:02,615 --> 00:09:04,959
So that's basically what these two pieces are saying.

80
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,943
We have inspiration when intrapulmonary pressure is less

81
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:11,629
than atmospheric pressure, and then expiration when intrapulmonary

82
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:13,973
pressure is greater than atmospheric pressure.

83
00:09:15,877 --> 00:09:19,003
One thing to kind of keep in mind is sort of a

84
00:09:19,003 --> 00:09:23,612
little bit separate, but it still has to deal with what we're talking about is Boyle's law.

85
00:09:24,794 --> 00:09:25,355
We know this.

86
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:32,068
If you kind of decrease the pressure here, you're going to increase the volume.

87
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:33,852
And then if you increase the pressure, you're going to

88
00:09:33,852 --> 00:09:37,058
decrease the volume inside of a closed container space.

89
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:45,704
OK, changes in thoracic cavity size during breathing.

90
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:48,846
Luckily, we've kind of touched on this.

91
00:09:48,846 --> 00:09:51,189
This is one of the mechanisms that we use to

92
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:54,992
increase kind of that end-diastolic volume or the venous return.

93
00:09:56,333 --> 00:10:00,037
So if we undergo inspiration, the diaphragm actually pushes

94
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:02,299
downwards, and the ribs kind of lift outward.

95
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,062
That helps increase the volume of the lungs.

96
00:10:09,305 --> 00:10:10,386
And that would be this piece here.

97
00:10:13,555 --> 00:10:19,707
During expiration, the diaphragm just relaxes.

98
00:10:19,707 --> 00:10:22,914
And once the diaphragm relaxes, it returns to its normal position.

99
00:10:23,775 --> 00:10:27,523
And the ribs just normally go back to its position as well.

100
00:10:27,523 --> 00:10:30,729
And then that helps decrease the volume of the lungs.

101
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:32,172
And we expire some of that air.

102
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,425
You can almost think of it like a rubber band.

103
00:10:37,425 --> 00:10:40,033
So if you expand the rubber band, then you just let it go.

104
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:42,842
It'll compress on its own or go back to its original position.

105
00:10:43,765 --> 00:10:46,233
Going back to that original position is going to increase

106
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:48,861
the pressure inside of the lungs to move the air out.

107
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:56,553
But especially during exercise, we do need to engage

108
00:10:56,553 --> 00:11:00,417
some respiratory muscles to forcefully push some of the air out.

109
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:08,587
And so we do use other muscles in order to help with moving air in and out of our lungs,

110
00:11:08,587 --> 00:11:12,491
but you will never really be, not never, but in this

111
00:11:12,491 --> 00:11:18,578
course, we're not really going to be testing whether you know the locations of these muscles here.

112
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:22,859
This is basically just saying there are muscles that we

113
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,026
use primarily or a little bit more dominantly on inspiration versus expiration.

114
00:11:29,128 --> 00:11:32,792
But especially during rest or maybe very light exercise,

115
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:40,863
it's really just you're working on the diaphragm and then you just let everything relax on its own.

116
00:11:40,863 --> 00:11:44,548
So we would call all of these like accessory muscles for respiration.

117
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,728
Okay, so sometimes I like to show this slide just because

118
00:11:52,728 --> 00:11:55,232
you're in the middle of things in the semester and it can

119
00:11:55,232 --> 00:12:01,562
get a little stressful, but it's always a good reminder to just breathe sometimes, right?

120
00:12:01,562 --> 00:12:03,766
Independent of the fact that

121
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:06,229
A nice deep breath might help you relax by

122
00:12:06,229 --> 00:12:09,972
maybe inhibiting the sympathetic nervous system to prevent the

123
00:12:09,972 --> 00:12:12,976
release of cortisol as well as maybe activate the

124
00:12:12,976 --> 00:12:17,080
parasympathetic nervous system to reduce some heart rate.

125
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,802
No, we're not even worried about all that, right?

126
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:22,185
You just, all right, it's gonna be okay, right?

127
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:23,226
Like it's gonna be okay.

128
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:25,569
All right.

129
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,634
But the other topic I like to talk about is nasal strips.

130
00:12:32,588 --> 00:12:34,472
So let me bring this in.

131
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,946
You've probably thought about this, or maybe you've heard about this.

132
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:46,137
So I'm going to ask you, do nasal strips reduce the work of breathing during exercise?

133
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,542
True or false?

134
00:12:50,526 --> 00:12:51,508
What do we think about this?

135
00:13:47,564 --> 00:13:54,991
Let's try a couple more seconds on this one, maybe 15 seconds or so.

136
00:13:54,991 --> 00:13:56,433
Does anyone need more time getting set up?

137
00:13:57,654 --> 00:14:16,052
OK, yeah, take your time.

138
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:21,792
All right, how about 45 seconds from now?

139
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:22,434
We're doing okay?

140
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:25,700
Maybe shorter?

141
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:29,527
All right, 10 seconds.

142
00:14:29,527 --> 00:14:31,531
Double check you got something in.

143
00:14:31,531 --> 00:14:36,060
Feel like we're a little light today, but it looks like we have a decent number in here.

144
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:42,512
Okay, I'll close this down in three, two, one.

145
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,781
All right.

146
00:14:47,781 --> 00:14:53,868
I'd just like to show this because we'll talk about

147
00:14:53,868 --> 00:14:59,595
this, but in past semesters, most people, it's usually like 50-50.

148
00:14:59,595 --> 00:15:03,319
I don't know if it's because you've kind of caught on

149
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:09,766
to how these questions are going when I usually present them, but why are we thinking false?

150
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:14,211
I actually like that answer, but maybe true or false.

151
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:14,912
Any ideas?

152
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,812
Yeah, and what was that first part you said?

153
00:15:24,634 --> 00:15:26,776
Yeah, most of the muscles are in the chest.

154
00:15:26,776 --> 00:15:29,579
But I guess, so you are correct about that, but what's

155
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:33,503
the point, or for the people who said true, what's the point of a nasal strip?

156
00:15:36,405 --> 00:15:39,989
Yeah, decrease resistance, and especially in the nostrils here.

157
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:46,696
So then if I'm increasing the airflow in the nostrils, why wouldn't maybe that work?

158
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:49,759
Why wouldn't that maybe

159
00:15:51,443 --> 00:15:52,846
improve athletic performance.

160
00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:00,802
So the majority of you said false, and I feel like you're on the right track here, but maybe why?

161
00:16:00,802 --> 00:16:02,065
Because I am curious.

162
00:16:02,065 --> 00:16:08,518
And it could just be because... Yeah.

163
00:16:08,518 --> 00:16:11,123
And so that's one of the biggest things, right?

164
00:16:12,436 --> 00:16:16,041
If you try primarily breathing through your nostrils, that's

165
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:21,750
always going to be much harder than if you start breathing through your mouth, right?

166
00:16:22,611 --> 00:16:26,637
And one of the biggest things that we sometimes forget

167
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:34,068
is, yeah, at rest and maybe light exercise, most of the ventilation does occur through the nose.

168
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:39,857
But as you increase with exercise intensity, airflow maybe can

169
00:16:39,857 --> 00:16:42,240
be through both of them or one of them.

170
00:16:43,115 --> 00:16:47,381
But what would be the primary limiting factor in bringing more air in?

171
00:16:52,527 --> 00:16:54,650
So whether I'm breathing through my mouth and my nose.

172
00:16:57,033 --> 00:17:02,440
Yeah, how much oxygen your body can take in as well as what's another physical limitation?

173
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:07,504
Yeah, so your trachea.

174
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:10,928
Eventually, it doesn't matter how much air is moving in

175
00:17:10,928 --> 00:17:14,332
through either your mouth and your nose, but then the trachea is

176
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:16,194
going to limit how much air you can push through.

177
00:17:17,095 --> 00:17:20,319
So theoretically, nasal strips would increase airflow into

178
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,581
the lungs by reducing airway resistance.

179
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:23,783
That's the whole idea.

180
00:17:23,783 --> 00:17:28,508
But it really doesn't do a whole lot.

181
00:17:28,508 --> 00:17:33,473
The only thing that they did find was it changes the switch point.

182
00:17:33,473 --> 00:17:37,056
And the switch point is basically when you start maybe

183
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:41,620
breathing through the mouth versus only the nose.

184
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:46,445
So if you're just relying on your nasopharynx to breathe, you would be able to do

185
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:50,388
that for longer or for higher intensities before you have

186
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:55,373
to switch to maybe both or just one breathing through your mouth.

187
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:58,258
So it doesn't necessarily improve performance, but it

188
00:17:58,258 --> 00:18:02,485
could potentially improve your ability to perform when only breathing through your nose.

189
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:05,710
So that's pretty much what they found here.

190
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:10,499
That's no surprise if you think about the physical limitation of the trachea itself.

191
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:18,762
And they sometimes call this switch point, like they give you terms where if you can sing,

192
00:18:18,762 --> 00:18:21,265
then that's probably a really low intensity.

193
00:18:21,265 --> 00:18:26,352
If you can talk while exercising, then things are getting a little bit harder.

194
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:29,716
But then once you start getting quiet, so it's like the

195
00:18:29,716 --> 00:18:37,106
sing, talking, and shut up, then you know when you can't talk anymore, you're working really hard.

196
00:18:37,106 --> 00:18:38,247
And you've probably done that before.

197
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:41,291
If someone's just talking and yapping away when you're

198
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:46,977
just really struggling running, then you're probably thinking that in your head a little bit.

199
00:18:46,977 --> 00:18:50,425
OK, so yeah, nasal dilator strips do not work.

200
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:55,155
There was no difference even in the switch point between these two.

201
00:18:55,155 --> 00:18:57,520
No significant difference, although some did improve.

202
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:05,337
But the biggest thing would be is there's just no reduction in the work of breathing.

203
00:19:05,337 --> 00:19:08,581
So if we really believed that there was some type

204
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:12,066
of improvement or we are increasing the ability of the

205
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:17,273
air to get in, then the respiratory muscles themselves should be working less.

206
00:19:17,273 --> 00:19:23,821
And there was no difference between nasal strips or the control or placebo.

207
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:28,307
So definitely does improve nasal breathing, but doesn't improve performance.

208
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,885
OK, so let's move on to pulmonary ventilation then.

209
00:19:34,885 --> 00:19:38,553
Before we go into pulmonary ventilation, I'll often show

210
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:43,182
these four little boxes here, and we'll start moving our way down these four boxes.

211
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,486
So we're going to start with pulmonary ventilation, then

212
00:19:45,486 --> 00:19:50,937
go to alveolar gas exchange, gas transport, and systemic gas exchange, and then kind of coming back out.

213
00:19:53,684 --> 00:19:57,069
As you might already know, pulmonary ventilation is

214
00:19:57,069 --> 00:20:00,073
also called minute ventilation or expired ventilation.

215
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,417
So most of the time, we're only measuring the

216
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:06,763
expired ventilation, not necessarily the inspired ventilation.

217
00:20:07,824 --> 00:20:10,408
So that's this VE over here.

218
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:14,073
And that's really just the amount of air that's moved in and out of the lungs per minute.

219
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:22,105
The tidal volume is the amount of air that you're moving per breath.

220
00:20:23,536 --> 00:20:26,220
So you can think of this almost like very similar to

221
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,947
how we measure stroke volume, the volume of blood leaving the heart.

222
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:35,752
Well, this is the volume of air leaving the lungs per breath.

223
00:20:36,814 --> 00:20:41,440
The breathing frequency is just the number of breaths per minute.

224
00:20:43,182 --> 00:20:47,468
So if you remember, that's very similar to beats per minute or heart rate.

225
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:55,909
You multiply those two together, you get VE, again, very similar to the concept of cardiac output.

226
00:20:57,071 --> 00:20:59,876
So you have this absolute amount of air that you're moving

227
00:21:00,778 --> 00:21:08,934
at a given frequency, so we get the total expired ventilation.

228
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,317
One thing to note, though,

229
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,023
This is not something you need to know, but we need

230
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:18,533
to be really careful about this concept of anatomical dead space.

231
00:21:19,475 --> 00:21:24,387
So even though we're moving all of this air in and out of our lungs,

232
00:21:24,387 --> 00:21:28,492
There is a portion from the bottom of your trachea all the

233
00:21:28,492 --> 00:21:32,598
way up to your mouth and the end of your nasopharynx.

234
00:21:32,598 --> 00:21:35,461
That actually doesn't exchange any gas.

235
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,145
You're just moving air back and forth.

236
00:21:38,145 --> 00:21:41,529
And so that is considered anatomical dead space, because

237
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:44,713
we're not really exchanging gas with the alveoli.

238
00:21:44,713 --> 00:21:48,518
And that doesn't really get a chance to diffuse into the lungs.

239
00:21:48,518 --> 00:21:52,846
So that's not accounted for here, but just know that that

240
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:55,992
becomes a little bit of an issue in certain instances.

241
00:21:55,992 --> 00:22:01,763
So if you were to hyperventilate at a really, really high frequency, then you're not allowing

242
00:22:01,763 --> 00:22:04,327
for the lungs to fully inflate, sort of like the

243
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:09,730
same concept we were talking about with filling time, and you would just

244
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,474
ventilate with anatomical dead space and that's when

245
00:22:12,474 --> 00:22:15,278
usually people have problems and they hyperventilate and they need

246
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:17,601
to like breathe into a bag, things like that, right?

247
00:22:17,601 --> 00:22:21,286
Because you're just really moving air from the anatomical dead

248
00:22:21,286 --> 00:22:25,812
space and instead you want to take nice big deep breaths to try

249
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:29,477
to get all of the air down to the gas exchange area.

250
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:37,267
OK, so moving on from that, the ventilatory responses,

251
00:22:37,267 --> 00:22:44,177
if we have expired ventilation, it does increase with increasing exercise intensity.

252
00:22:44,177 --> 00:22:46,881
So here, if we have light exercise, maybe we're at

253
00:22:46,881 --> 00:22:53,892
40 liters per minute, moderate at 80, severe around 120 liters per minute.

254
00:22:53,892 --> 00:22:56,236
And so that's a decent amount of air.

255
00:22:56,236 --> 00:23:00,124
If you think of a two-liter bottle, if you have 60

256
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:02,729
of those, that's how much you're moving in and out of

257
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:08,119
your lungs every minute during this high or heavy intensity exercise.

258
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:12,187
And you probably noticed this when you were using the Douglas bag technique.

259
00:23:12,187 --> 00:23:15,934
Those bags started to fill up pretty quick at some of those higher intensities.

260
00:23:17,753 --> 00:23:21,559
I will say, though this is typically the average

261
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:28,550
ventilation towards heavy or maximal exercise, we did some research with category one cyclists.

262
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:32,377
So these are basically professional cyclists, cat one cyclists.

263
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:37,565
And they had upwards of 222 liters per minute for their ventilation.

264
00:23:37,565 --> 00:23:42,593
So they were quite a bit higher than what we're seeing here.

265
00:23:42,593 --> 00:23:44,759
And yeah, that was a little bit high.

266
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:47,969
But on average, I think they were at 200.

267
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:48,852
So there are people at 180.

268
00:23:49,674 --> 00:23:51,379
Some people are at 215.

269
00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:56,113
So just know that it is possible to get quite a bit higher than this 120 mark here.

270
00:24:00,498 --> 00:24:04,085
All right, tidal volume, breathing frequency during graded exercise tests.

271
00:24:04,085 --> 00:24:07,431
This is more of the same concept here.

272
00:24:07,431 --> 00:24:10,337
As I'm increasing exercise intensity down here on the

273
00:24:10,337 --> 00:24:15,347
x-axis, I am increasing the respiratory rate on the y-axis.

274
00:24:15,347 --> 00:24:18,813
So that's going to increase relatively linearly here.

275
00:24:18,813 --> 00:24:23,282
Tidal volume will also increase as we increase with exercise intensity here.

276
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:32,371
the changes in breathing pattern here.

277
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:37,519
The way you want to kind of interpret this figure here is

278
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:45,411
as I am increasing the kind of height, I am increasing the tidal volume.

279
00:24:47,093 --> 00:24:53,923
As I'm bringing the waveforms closer and closer together, I am increasing the frequency.

280
00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:58,450
So you can see from

281
00:24:59,442 --> 00:25:03,806
I guess heavy exercise all the way to very heavy

282
00:25:03,806 --> 00:25:12,215
exercise, the tidal volume isn't as maybe impactful as the change in frequency.

283
00:25:12,215 --> 00:25:14,357
So typically we have an increase in frequency at

284
00:25:14,357 --> 00:25:17,480
those higher intensities as opposed to tidal volume.

285
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,702
And that should make a little bit of sense, one,

286
00:25:19,702 --> 00:25:24,687
because we're reducing the filling time of the lungs, but two, we are kind of

287
00:25:24,687 --> 00:25:28,773
at some type of max as far as how much air our lungs

288
00:25:28,773 --> 00:25:34,140
can move in and out or how much our lungs can move air in and out of those spaces.

289
00:25:35,522 --> 00:25:41,571
So typically the tide of volume kind of plateaus a little bit faster than the frequency.

290
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,060
Any questions on this one?

291
00:25:50,444 --> 00:25:50,644
All right.

292
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:56,825
Okay, so what about the control of ventilation at rest and during exercise?

293
00:25:58,206 --> 00:26:00,289
So I'm trying to bring it back to the same kind

294
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:04,192
of pathway that we did with the cardiovascular system or the heart,

295
00:26:04,192 --> 00:26:08,036
is we want to focus on maybe what is happening with

296
00:26:08,036 --> 00:26:12,381
the pulmonary system and then how we're actually getting this control to happen.

297
00:26:13,722 --> 00:26:16,865
Okay, so control of ventilation at rest.

298
00:26:16,865 --> 00:26:18,687
So we're focusing at rest here.

299
00:26:19,648 --> 00:26:21,610
So inspiration and expiration.

300
00:26:22,906 --> 00:26:26,493
We are, again, contracting and relaxing the diaphragm.

301
00:26:27,596 --> 00:26:31,043
This is controlled by somatic motor neurons, so those kind

302
00:26:31,043 --> 00:26:33,488
of skeletal muscles or the muscles in the diaphragm.

303
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:38,598
And that is basically those signals in the spinal cord

304
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:42,366
as well as the respiratory center in the medulla oblongata.

305
00:26:49,197 --> 00:26:52,541
If those signals are coming from those two regions in

306
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:58,870
our nervous system, then we should think about how that's actually causing us to start to breathe.

307
00:27:00,512 --> 00:27:02,014
So number one, neural input.

308
00:27:03,636 --> 00:27:08,343
So from the motor cortex and the skeletal muscle mechanoreceptors.

309
00:27:10,986 --> 00:27:16,855
So once you start exercising, what this is saying is,

310
00:27:16,855 --> 00:27:19,700
There's something coming from the motor cortex as

311
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,447
well as the skeletal muscle mechanoreceptors that are sending that

312
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:30,018
signal back up to tell the brain to send a signal to the lungs to increase ventilation.

313
00:27:33,404 --> 00:27:36,169
Those signals are coming from the muscle spindles, the

314
00:27:36,169 --> 00:27:42,019
Golgi tendon organs, and the joint pressure receptors, as well as that motor cortex.

315
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:47,252
So as soon as you get activation or some changes

316
00:27:47,252 --> 00:27:53,286
in those signaling at the muscles, they are synapsing and telling your brain to increase ventilation.

317
00:27:56,052 --> 00:28:04,190
Which is kind of cool because if you were to do the study and they have, you know the little like

318
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:08,797
TENS machines that they sometimes put on you at the physical therapy.

319
00:28:08,797 --> 00:28:14,745
If you put enough of those on a large enough or a large kind of muscle area

320
00:28:14,745 --> 00:28:18,491
and you increase the stimulation, those individuals will all

321
00:28:18,491 --> 00:28:20,654
of a sudden start to increase their ventilation.

322
00:28:22,156 --> 00:28:25,381
So those signals are just being sent to increase ventilation.

323
00:28:25,381 --> 00:28:29,367
So as soon as you start exercising, your muscles are

324
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:32,391
sending signals to the brain to say, hey, increase that ventilation.

325
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:36,134
OK, so that's this piece here.

326
00:28:36,134 --> 00:28:39,077
We have some receptors in the muscles and the joints.

327
00:28:39,077 --> 00:28:41,780
Those are sending signals to the respiratory center.

328
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,082
And then those kind of go up to the higher brain centers.

329
00:28:44,082 --> 00:28:50,889
But then you're also then sending those signals back down to increase ventilation.

330
00:28:50,889 --> 00:28:51,290
Pretty cool.

331
00:28:54,493 --> 00:28:59,037
And that would go to the same if you were like lifting weights or something like that.

332
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:02,459
OK, number two, humoral.

333
00:29:02,459 --> 00:29:04,601
So humorals kind of like inside of the blood.

334
00:29:05,682 --> 00:29:06,823
And then chemoreceptors.

335
00:29:07,964 --> 00:29:11,287
We have two locations for these chemoreceptors.

336
00:29:11,287 --> 00:29:14,510
The central chemoreceptors, which are located in the medulla.

337
00:29:16,312 --> 00:29:22,597
Those, well, you have some other receptors as well that

338
00:29:22,597 --> 00:29:29,163
are kind of sensitive to partial pressure of CO2 as well as hydrogen concentrations.

339
00:29:29,163 --> 00:29:31,065
And those are in the cerebral spinal fluid.

340
00:29:34,184 --> 00:29:37,889
So anytime you think central chemoreceptors, think central nervous system.

341
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,414
They're located in the central nervous system.

342
00:29:41,414 --> 00:29:46,200
They are a little bit more sensitive to the partial pressure of CO2 and hydrogen ions,

343
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,705
and they are gonna cause, depending on the influx of

344
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:56,094
them, are gonna cause an individual to increase or decrease ventilation.

345
00:29:56,094 --> 00:30:01,121
The peripheral chemoreceptors, they're not really like in the periphery like your fingers.

346
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:03,364
They're just not in the central nervous system.

347
00:30:04,407 --> 00:30:07,073
In particular, the aortic and carotid bodies.

348
00:30:09,678 --> 00:30:12,384
These chemoreceptors are a little bit more sensitive to

349
00:30:12,384 --> 00:30:21,724
partial pressure changes in oxygen, CO2, as well as ion changes in hydrogen and potassium.

350
00:30:27,712 --> 00:30:33,438
Regardless of the chemoreceptor, does anyone know which one we rely on first?

351
00:30:33,438 --> 00:30:39,625
Meaning, which of these four, if they were to change, would

352
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:47,554
we respond to first as far as changing ventilation?

353
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,615
Hydrogen is close.

354
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:52,960
It's not hydrogen, so now it's one out of three now.

355
00:30:54,762 --> 00:30:56,665
It is the partial pressure of CO2.

356
00:30:56,665 --> 00:30:59,349
So when you hold your breath and you get that

357
00:30:59,349 --> 00:31:03,014
little urge to breathe, that's because you're building up CO2 pressure.

358
00:31:04,336 --> 00:31:07,060
The one thing I will note, especially when we get

359
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:15,333
to altitude, it changes at rapid or acute changes in elevation.

360
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:18,177
If you go to Pike's Peak, you will immediately

361
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:23,183
start increasing ventilation because of a large change in partial pressure of oxygen.

362
00:31:23,183 --> 00:31:28,269
But the primary sensitivity that's coming from these chemoreceptors is CO2.

363
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:32,094
It then switches to oxygen if you start changing

364
00:31:32,094 --> 00:31:35,518
elevation or the inspired partial pressure of oxygen.

365
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:43,799
OK, so these central peripheral chemoreceptors, this is a nice little figure here.

366
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:49,349
So you have some of these kind of sending signals to increase respiration.

367
00:31:53,597 --> 00:31:56,362
OK, so that was at rest, right?

368
00:31:58,386 --> 00:31:59,869
We still have these.

369
00:32:00,676 --> 00:32:04,661
I guess, sensor our sensors when we exercise, but

370
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:10,069
we now have preferential treatment on what's controlling ventilation.

371
00:32:12,672 --> 00:32:14,154
I can't stress this enough, right?

372
00:32:14,154 --> 00:32:17,038
Like I need to underline this, right?

373
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:26,275
So ventilatory control during submaximal exercise is primarily mediated by the neural input.

374
00:32:26,275 --> 00:32:27,878
So that number one, right?

375
00:32:27,878 --> 00:32:31,103
We talked about neuro and humoral.

376
00:32:31,103 --> 00:32:37,013
Well, submaximal exercise is primarily mediated by neural input.

377
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:43,605
So that's this kind of piece over here, this neural piece.

378
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:51,338
So we're still on submaximal.

379
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:56,313
So you have your higher brain centers and your

380
00:32:56,313 --> 00:32:59,397
respiratory muscle control centers, and then you have your

381
00:32:59,397 --> 00:33:03,162
peripheral chemoreceptors and all of these pieces.

382
00:33:03,162 --> 00:33:09,650
But the primary drive to increase ventilation is the higher brain centers.

383
00:33:10,732 --> 00:33:22,087
Secondary would be these chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors down over here.

384
00:33:22,087 --> 00:33:22,287
All right.

385
00:33:25,034 --> 00:33:26,116
I do have a note in here.

386
00:33:26,116 --> 00:33:34,194
Temperature is not on here, but temperature is a driver of ventilation.

387
00:33:34,194 --> 00:33:35,156
So it'd be the same thing.

388
00:33:35,156 --> 00:33:37,722
If I just increase the temperature here high enough

389
00:33:37,722 --> 00:33:39,847
for everyone and your core body temperature started to

390
00:33:39,847 --> 00:33:44,238
increase, you will start to increase your ventilation.

391
00:33:44,238 --> 00:33:48,344
Most people think it's very similar to like dog's

392
00:33:48,344 --> 00:33:53,170
pant because that's their primary drive of thermal regulation.

393
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:56,114
They need to exhale that heat out.

394
00:33:56,114 --> 00:34:00,660
It is believed that we also increase ventilation to try to exhale some heat.

395
00:34:02,202 --> 00:34:05,126
But it's a little bit controversial as far as the

396
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,950
magnitude of temperature change due to that ventilation.

397
00:34:10,377 --> 00:34:15,284
OK, this looks the same, but it is kind of trying to get at a different point here.

398
00:34:16,086 --> 00:34:24,478
Ventilatory control during maximal exercise is primarily mediated by humoral input.

399
00:34:26,802 --> 00:34:31,319
So submaximal is primarily neural.

400
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:35,245
maximal exercise is primarily humoral.

401
00:34:36,067 --> 00:34:39,332
That doesn't mean that's the only thing going on.

402
00:34:39,332 --> 00:34:42,918
It's just primarily mediated by humoral factors.

403
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,642
And so that would be this piece over here.

404
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,715
Any questions on that?

405
00:35:00,445 --> 00:35:06,213
Again, just try to circle rest, submaximal, maximal.

406
00:35:10,538 --> 00:35:10,819
All right.

407
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:13,542
OK, so that kind of finishes the pulmonary ventilation.

408
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:16,807
We can now move to alveolar gas exchange.

409
00:35:18,469 --> 00:35:22,033
Finally, we moved all the air into our lungs.

410
00:35:23,856 --> 00:35:28,897
We want to get the important pieces into the blood.

411
00:35:28,897 --> 00:35:31,120
and some waste products out of the blood.

412
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,365
So oxygen into the blood, CO2 out.

413
00:35:35,365 --> 00:35:37,608
That means we need to focus on the partial pressure

414
00:35:37,608 --> 00:35:45,778
of oxygen, PO2, and then the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, PCO2.

415
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:55,829
Sometimes you will see letters after the P. That just indicates location.

416
00:35:55,829 --> 00:36:01,878
So if I saw PI02, that's the inspiratory partial pressure of oxygen.

417
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,987
If I saw a little a, it'd be PA02, so not

418
00:36:07,987 --> 00:36:13,115
capitalized, lowercase a, that would be the partial pressure of oxygen in the arteries.

419
00:36:14,337 --> 00:36:16,580
So we'll go through that, but just if you see

420
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:21,027
those small little letters there, they're just kind of keying you in on the location.

421
00:36:22,593 --> 00:36:24,696
OK, so this should look relatively familiar.

422
00:36:24,696 --> 00:36:30,704
We have some type of partial pressure of oxygen inside of the inspired air, so the environment.

423
00:36:30,704 --> 00:36:33,949
We bring that in into the lungs.

424
00:36:33,949 --> 00:36:37,894
We get a little bit of humidification, so the partial pressure drops.

425
00:36:37,894 --> 00:36:44,544
And we want to match this partial pressure, this 104, with the partial pressure in the lungs.

426
00:36:44,544 --> 00:36:49,728
So we're diffusing some of that oxygen down into the blood.

427
00:36:49,728 --> 00:36:52,934
And then you lose a little bit because you're feeding some of the other organs.

428
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:54,678
So you're down at 95.

429
00:36:54,678 --> 00:36:57,323
And now the partial pressure at 95 is here.

430
00:36:57,323 --> 00:36:58,966
It's going to drop off some oxygen.

431
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,351
And then we're going to get 40 back in the veins.

432
00:37:02,794 --> 00:37:05,740
So it's nice to kind of keep these numbers in the back of your mind.

433
00:37:06,662 --> 00:37:09,117
You would never really need to like,

434
00:37:09,117 --> 00:37:14,785
be quizzed on when or what value is in the venous blood versus the arteries.

435
00:37:14,785 --> 00:37:18,230
But sometimes it would help if you kind of keep an idea of like 100.

436
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,595
Around 100 is the partial pressure of oxygen in the arteries.

437
00:37:21,595 --> 00:37:25,080
And then around 40 is the partial pressure of oxygen in the veins.

438
00:37:28,945 --> 00:37:31,389
You'll spend some more time in lab with these calculations.

439
00:37:31,389 --> 00:37:34,433
But again, just kind of keep those in the back of your mind.

440
00:37:36,674 --> 00:37:40,581
Okay, so pulmonary capillaries are pretty much going to grab

441
00:37:40,581 --> 00:37:43,806
some of that oxygen or allow for the diffusion to occur.

442
00:37:43,806 --> 00:37:46,591
So we have air inside of these alveoli.

443
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:50,258
And yes, they're going to exchange with these capillary beds here.

444
00:37:50,258 --> 00:37:53,383
And hopefully we can then move that back to the heart.

445
00:37:58,848 --> 00:38:03,219
clinically or some clinical applications to this is

446
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:06,507
quite relevant, especially because we were dealing with a

447
00:38:06,507 --> 00:38:12,297
quite severe pulmonary disorder or disease with COVID.

448
00:38:12,297 --> 00:38:17,588
Interestingly, or I guess not surprisingly, it's causing some

449
00:38:17,588 --> 00:38:23,280
issues with individuals who had some of these moderate to severe symptoms.

450
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,328
So they can promote lung injury because they are

451
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,795
collecting additional fluid inside of the alveoli.

452
00:38:31,973 --> 00:38:38,220
in addition to the space between the capillary as well as the alveoli wall.

453
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,585
So you're almost increasing the diffusion distance if you have

454
00:38:42,585 --> 00:38:44,567
some type of fluid buildup in those areas.

455
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:52,916
That means you are kind of experiencing a reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen.

456
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:55,767
So a healthy kind of

457
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:59,397
alveolar bed here is looking like this.

458
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:03,348
If you have an infection that's going to cause some sort of response,

459
00:39:04,431 --> 00:39:08,062
and the response as well as the damage from the infection

460
00:39:08,062 --> 00:39:11,110
itself is going to cause a little bit of fluid buildup here.

461
00:39:12,372 --> 00:39:17,080
If you had severe fluid buildup, then that would cause a pretty big problem.

462
00:39:17,901 --> 00:39:20,045
An example of that would be this here.

463
00:39:20,045 --> 00:39:22,389
So this would be moderate damage, and we have some

464
00:39:22,389 --> 00:39:25,354
fluid buildup because we have an immune response.

465
00:39:25,354 --> 00:39:27,718
Well, now I'm not going to be able to exchange gas

466
00:39:27,718 --> 00:39:31,084
down here, and I'm really just relying on these smaller pieces over here.

467
00:39:32,606 --> 00:39:37,280
If I had severe damage, then there's really

468
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:45,513
very, very little room to exchange any type of gas between the capillary as well as the alveoli.

469
00:39:45,513 --> 00:39:51,623
And so this is why it was so important for individuals who had severe COVID to go on a ventilator,

470
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:55,128
because they were trying to really one force air in

471
00:39:55,128 --> 00:39:58,233
there, but increase the partial pressure of oxygen to kind

472
00:39:58,233 --> 00:40:02,460
of maximize the alveoli that were available to exchange gas.

473
00:40:05,815 --> 00:40:13,182
We also actually see this with maybe extreme high-altitude issues.

474
00:40:13,182 --> 00:40:17,986
So we call it like HAPE, so high-altitude pulmonary edema.

475
00:40:17,986 --> 00:40:23,851
You can actually get fluid to just seep into the lungs, and then you get the same issue as this.

476
00:40:26,914 --> 00:40:30,157
So not good to have fluid inside of your lungs, outside fluid.

477
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,780
OK, blood flow to the lung.

478
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:39,822
Pulmonary arteries receive mixed venous blood from the right ventricle.

479
00:40:39,822 --> 00:40:44,789
Oxygenated blood returned to the left atrium via the pulmonary vein.

480
00:40:46,332 --> 00:40:52,380
The low pressure system with the rate of blood flow equal to the systemic circuit.

481
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,783
We kind of already touched on this.

482
00:40:53,783 --> 00:40:56,527
If you have any change in pressure inside of any

483
00:40:56,527 --> 00:41:01,614
of that system, whether it's the pulmonary system or the systemic,

484
00:41:01,614 --> 00:41:05,992
you are going to have blood move from high pressure to low pressure.

485
00:41:05,992 --> 00:41:09,195
And that's the same with movement of air flow.

486
00:41:17,284 --> 00:41:18,765
OK, blood flow to the lung.

487
00:41:18,765 --> 00:41:23,911
So during resting conditions or standing, most of the blood flow is to the base of the lung.

488
00:41:24,912 --> 00:41:28,315
That is just due to the gravitational forces, right?

489
00:41:28,315 --> 00:41:32,806
If we're standing up and down, most of the blood flow is kind of

490
00:41:32,806 --> 00:41:39,090
not really pool, but it's going to kind of aggregate towards the bottom of the lung.

491
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:42,985
During upright exercise, blood flow does increase to the top of the lung.

492
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:51,417
You also see this as a little bit of an issue with astronauts who go to microgravity.

493
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:56,663
Or again, if you simulate microgravity, then some of that blood is going to rush towards the apex.

494
00:41:56,663 --> 00:41:59,045
And it sometimes does cause a little bit of a

495
00:41:59,045 --> 00:42:05,773
problem, because then you start pushing plasma out of the capillaries and into that space.

496
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:14,262
And we don't really want to do that.

497
00:42:14,262 --> 00:42:14,322
OK.

498
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:21,527
This one's kind of straightforward, but if you happen to,

499
00:42:21,527 --> 00:42:26,598
what happens to blood flow in the lung during supine or face up or prone face down exercise,

500
00:42:26,598 --> 00:42:29,123
and I guess this is a little bit different because

501
00:42:29,123 --> 00:42:32,910
they're traveling a certain direction as well, but if someone

502
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:38,622
is face down or prone, if they're laying down, most of the blood will kind of aggregate where?

503
00:42:40,846 --> 00:42:47,477
Yeah, towards the top of the lung, and then if you decide to flip yourself upside down

504
00:42:47,477 --> 00:42:51,444
or maybe you want a trip to go on one of those

505
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:57,153
space flights, then most of the blood will kind of pool down to the top of the lung.

506
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,664
Okay, ventilation-perfusion relationships.

507
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:10,062
This is important because even though, or even if the

508
00:43:10,062 --> 00:43:15,449
alveoli are well ventilated, if you don't have adequate blood

509
00:43:15,449 --> 00:43:19,974
flow, then that's still going to impair gas exchange.

510
00:43:23,419 --> 00:43:30,107
This then introduces the topic or the concept of ventilation-perfusion ratio.

511
00:43:30,931 --> 00:43:34,056
We also call that the V-Q ratio.

512
00:43:35,137 --> 00:43:40,726
We say this is V because this is ventilation, Q

513
00:43:40,726 --> 00:43:44,452
because that's more referring to the cardiac output or blood flow.

514
00:43:46,355 --> 00:43:49,580
So the V is ventilation, the Q is blood flow.

515
00:43:51,643 --> 00:43:56,230
Sometimes, right, perfusion pressure, perfusion, that's usually referring to blood.

516
00:43:58,133 --> 00:44:02,258
Okay, so this indicates a matching of blood flow to ventilation.

517
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:09,667
An ideal V-Q ratio is about one or slightly above if

518
00:44:09,667 --> 00:44:17,637
your blood flow is a little bit higher, meaning maybe moderate to heavy exercise.

519
00:44:17,637 --> 00:44:20,401
So you can think of it this way, where if we

520
00:44:20,401 --> 00:44:26,048
have a blood vessel here or a pulmonary capillary, the blood is moving through that capillary.

521
00:44:27,192 --> 00:44:32,379
The speed at which this blood moves to the capillary

522
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:39,108
will dictate a little bit of how well saturated we can get some of those hemoglobin molecules.

523
00:44:40,991 --> 00:44:46,939
This pressure here from the alveoli is the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli.

524
00:44:49,028 --> 00:44:52,335
So here's another kind of piece down here.

525
00:44:52,335 --> 00:44:58,407
So the capital A is kind of referring to the alveoli.

526
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:05,822
So alveolar ventilation or pulmonary ventilation, and then cardiac output down here.

527
00:45:14,307 --> 00:45:22,444
We do have different VQ relationships depending on the anatomical location of the lung.

528
00:45:22,444 --> 00:45:29,859
So towards the apex, the ventilation can be at 0.24 liters per minute.

529
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:34,895
But the blood flow is going to be quite a bit lower at 0.07.

530
00:45:34,895 --> 00:45:36,539
And so the ratio is going to be about 3.43.

531
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:41,271
And in this instance, because it's well above 1, we

532
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:46,184
are saying it's underperfuse relative to the ventilation, meaning

533
00:45:46,184 --> 00:45:49,292
the ventilation is much higher than the blood flow.

534
00:45:52,107 --> 00:45:55,070
So we're not really maximizing things a whole lot because

535
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:58,733
you're getting a lot of oxygen into the lungs, but the

536
00:45:58,733 --> 00:46:02,276
blood's not really moving past, so you're not really maximizing

537
00:46:02,276 --> 00:46:06,339
the amount of transfer or diffusion of that oxygen into the blood.

538
00:46:08,561 --> 00:46:11,964
Here at the base, because again, the base of the lung

539
00:46:11,964 --> 00:46:15,908
has a higher blood flow compared to the apex.

540
00:46:15,908 --> 00:46:21,892
This does change whether you lay down or you go to microgravity or you flip on your head.

541
00:46:21,892 --> 00:46:27,500
So the ventilation will be 0.82, for example, on average, with the blood flow being 1.29.

542
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:33,148
The ratio then drops below 1 to 0.64.

543
00:46:33,148 --> 00:46:36,633
And so we would say this is over perfused relative

544
00:46:36,633 --> 00:46:43,042
to ventilation, meaning the ventilation is much lower than the blood flow.

545
00:46:44,925 --> 00:46:48,490
So in this instance, the blood is just moving too fast.

546
00:46:49,516 --> 00:46:54,283
And it's not giving enough time to allow for adequate

547
00:46:54,283 --> 00:46:59,750
oxygen delivery and transfer as well as saturation of those hemoglobin molecules.

548
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:04,216
We'll touch on this a little bit later, but this is

549
00:47:04,216 --> 00:47:08,983
a really good introduction to a concept called pulmonary capillary transit time.

550
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:15,605
So how quickly is the blood moving past the alveoli?

551
00:47:15,605 --> 00:47:18,451
that does determine how well we can saturate some of

552
00:47:18,451 --> 00:47:20,856
those red blood cells or those hemoglobin molecules.

553
00:47:28,852 --> 00:47:29,633
Any questions here?

554
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:33,040
Yeah.

555
00:47:38,521 --> 00:47:41,386
Yeah, the top one, we're saying the blood's moving too

556
00:47:41,386 --> 00:47:46,113
slow compared to the amount of air that we're moving in and out

557
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:49,559
of the lungs at the top of the lungs, at the apex.

558
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:50,641
At the base, it's flipped.

559
00:47:56,771 --> 00:47:57,832
Now these are examples.

560
00:47:57,832 --> 00:48:02,520
It's not always this way, but it starts changing a little bit when we exercise.

561
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,643
But it's nice to see

562
00:48:04,643 --> 00:48:08,609
that we sometimes have an imbalance in this VQ ratio

563
00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:15,380
and that could impair or maybe underutilize some of the diffusion and transfer of oxygen.

564
00:48:20,528 --> 00:48:22,611
Okay, so exercise-induced asthma here.

565
00:48:24,654 --> 00:48:28,440
This is caused by a contraction of smooth muscle around the airways.

566
00:48:30,496 --> 00:48:33,820
You also or those individuals typically also get a little

567
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:38,545
bit of mucus or some type of fluid buildup inside of the lungs or the airways.

568
00:48:40,107 --> 00:48:45,113
This can cause some labor breathing or dyspnea, so difficulty breathing.

569
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:48,958
It is characterized by a wheezing sound.

570
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:51,140
So sometimes you can hear this pretty well without a

571
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:55,705
stethoscope, but it's much easier to hear with a stethoscope.

572
00:48:55,705 --> 00:48:59,909
It does occur in about 10% of the elite endurance athletes.

573
00:48:59,909 --> 00:49:02,813
So it is relatively common.

574
00:49:05,436 --> 00:49:10,362
However, if it is corrected, we use some sort of inhaler

575
00:49:10,362 --> 00:49:22,056
or some sort of steroid, then we can manage this and it doesn't impair performance.

576
00:49:22,056 --> 00:49:23,858
And we'll talk about this a little bit more as well.

577
00:49:27,702 --> 00:49:33,335
All right, hopefully I've got your mind off of the VQ ratio because here we go.

578
00:49:33,335 --> 00:49:43,399
What will happen to the VQ ratio in a patient with asthma or a type of airway obstruction?

579
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:35,409
Okay, let's go, I don't know, 30 more seconds.

580
00:50:44,638 --> 00:50:45,839
Pretty excited for this one.

581
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,843
Thought I went slow enough through here.

582
00:50:49,843 --> 00:50:52,525
All right, 15 seconds unless someone needs a little more time.

583
00:50:52,525 --> 00:51:00,653
10 seconds, double check you have something in.

584
00:51:03,282 --> 00:51:07,127
I'll close it down in three, two, one.

585
00:51:13,095 --> 00:51:14,857
Oh, 96, that's good.

586
00:51:14,857 --> 00:51:15,237
That's good.

587
00:51:19,483 --> 00:51:24,329
Okay, so if you have asthma or any sort of airway

588
00:51:24,329 --> 00:51:28,935
obstruction, which is kind of depicted here in this figure, what happens to ventilation?

589
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,473
Yeah, it goes down.

590
00:51:32,677 --> 00:51:37,575
So by default, one of these ventilation is lower than blood flow.

591
00:51:46,415 --> 00:51:50,040
Okay, so local control of ventilation and perfusion, all is

592
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,604
not lost if we have some sort of airway obstruction.

593
00:51:53,604 --> 00:51:58,250
There are ways we can try to protect against and

594
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:05,259
under or over perfusion by making some adjustments to areas that we have control over.

595
00:52:05,259 --> 00:52:08,423
So for example, if we have some sort of

596
00:52:09,348 --> 00:52:13,172
narrowing of the airway or obstruction in the airway, the

597
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:18,698
body does respond by kind of reducing some of the perfusion.

598
00:52:18,698 --> 00:52:22,102
So pulmonary arteries serving these alveoli constrict.

599
00:52:23,023 --> 00:52:27,228
You would think, right, like there's nothing we can really

600
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:35,377
do, but we could just reduce the blood flow to try to match that inflow or the ventilation.

601
00:52:36,198 --> 00:52:38,140
And so we can try to

602
00:52:39,335 --> 00:52:44,740
correct the mismatch by constricting some of these alveoli.

603
00:52:46,341 --> 00:52:49,444
If an individual is exercising, that might not be the

604
00:52:49,444 --> 00:52:58,012
best option for performance, but I think we put on a higher order survival over your 10K performance.

605
00:52:58,012 --> 00:52:59,974
Okay, so if there's a blood clot then, so if you

606
00:52:59,974 --> 00:53:06,760
have a VQ ratio greater than one, then the pulmonary artery serving these alveoli can dilate.

607
00:53:07,921 --> 00:53:13,929
And so we can try to increase that flow to try to get back closer towards the one.

608
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,544
Now these are in response, right?

609
00:53:24,544 --> 00:53:33,557
We have a blood clot or we have some issue with the flow of blood going through these capillaries.

610
00:53:34,567 --> 00:53:39,795
And so it's possible we can try and correct that by vasodilating.

611
00:53:39,795 --> 00:53:44,963
If we already have some type of obstruction with ventilation, so ventilation goes way down,

612
00:53:44,963 --> 00:53:48,167
well, we can try to correct that by constricting or

613
00:53:48,167 --> 00:53:50,391
reducing some of the blood flow that's coming through there.

614
00:53:53,515 --> 00:53:55,378
You might think, why would we do that?

615
00:53:55,378 --> 00:53:57,782
Well, this is the concept that I first brought in

616
00:53:57,782 --> 00:54:01,367
a little bit earlier, a pulmonary capillary transit time.

617
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:08,107
So low to moderate intensity exercise does improve the VQ ratio.

618
00:54:08,968 --> 00:54:15,378
However, high intensity exercise results in a slight VQ inequality.

619
00:54:17,381 --> 00:54:19,685
So here's the best way to try to look at this.

620
00:54:20,747 --> 00:54:27,277
One, in both situations, the partial pressure of oxygen is the same.

621
00:54:28,118 --> 00:54:29,160
It's at 100.

622
00:54:30,997 --> 00:54:36,785
However, if I am exercising at max versus rest

623
00:54:36,785 --> 00:54:40,630
or sorry, max versus maybe moderate exercise intensity, we would

624
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:44,756
have some sort of cardiac output that's delivering blood to the lungs.

625
00:54:45,837 --> 00:54:48,080
The partial pressure of oxygen is 40 here.

626
00:54:49,061 --> 00:54:52,907
And so if it has enough time, so where the pulmonary

627
00:54:52,907 --> 00:54:58,047
capillary transit time is slow enough or long enough,

628
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:02,173
then there's plenty of time for the red blood cells

629
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:08,402
to pass through and fully saturate with oxygen, so now we're at 100.

630
00:55:08,402 --> 00:55:09,804
So there's just 100 to 100.

631
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:15,953
If, however, the blood is moving too fast because

632
00:55:15,953 --> 00:55:20,963
we're at high intensity exercise, the stroke volume, the cardiac output is quite high,

633
00:55:20,963 --> 00:55:25,312
then like what we knew before, the venous blood partial pressure

634
00:55:25,312 --> 00:55:29,240
of 40, but now some of these red blood cells are not

635
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,945
fully saturated and so now we have a partial pressure of 80.

636
00:55:33,809 --> 00:55:41,925
And that's when we get a substantial decrease or a shorter pulmonary capillary transit time.

637
00:55:44,521 --> 00:55:47,985
Now, I like to use this example, and it doesn't help everybody, but sometimes it does.

638
00:55:47,985 --> 00:55:51,710
And as long as it helps one person, I'm going to keep using this example.

639
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:56,055
But if you could imagine that on the side of a sidewalk there was a fire hydrant

640
00:55:56,055 --> 00:55:58,578
that was broken and it was just pushing water onto the

641
00:55:58,578 --> 00:56:03,824
sidewalk, that, to me, would be the partial pressure of oxygen.

642
00:56:03,824 --> 00:56:06,107
So you can imagine the water molecules are oxygen.

643
00:56:06,965 --> 00:56:10,969
Now, if you had to go through this kind of broken

644
00:56:10,969 --> 00:56:15,995
fire hydrant, I could walk through very slowly, and then all

645
00:56:15,995 --> 00:56:20,680
of my clothes would be fully saturated with water.

646
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:23,523
If I didn't want to do that, what would you try to do?

647
00:56:24,544 --> 00:56:25,726
Yeah, you would try to sprint through.

648
00:56:25,726 --> 00:56:28,709
So if I sprinted through as fast as I could, maybe just

649
00:56:28,709 --> 00:56:33,762
the right side of my clothes would be wet, but the left side would be dry.

650
00:56:33,762 --> 00:56:37,289
And so you could imagine the red blood cells that

651
00:56:37,289 --> 00:56:42,619
are furthest away from the alveoli might not have enough

652
00:56:42,619 --> 00:56:47,809
partial pressure to get fully saturated because they're just moving too fast past the alveoli.

653
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,522
We okay here?

654
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:01,755
This is pretty straightforward when we're thinking about it like this.

655
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:05,279
But once we get to elite athletes and high altitude,

656
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:10,946
well, now this number changes and pulmonary capillary transit

657
00:57:10,946 --> 00:57:13,749
time becomes even more important to think about.

658
00:57:13,749 --> 00:57:19,696
And it kind of causes this concept of exercise-induced arterial desaturation.

659
00:57:21,178 --> 00:57:22,399
But we'll get to that a little bit later.

660
00:57:26,817 --> 00:57:29,299
Any questions so far?

661
00:57:32,262 --> 00:57:33,223
Am I moving too slow?

662
00:57:34,024 --> 00:57:36,906
Trying to make sure we're, OK, cool.

663
00:57:36,906 --> 00:57:40,570
All right, so we talked about pulmonary ventilation.

664
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:43,953
We moved on to that alveolar gas exchange.

665
00:57:43,953 --> 00:57:50,178
And now we need to see, how are we going to get that O2 transport into the blood and muscle?

666
00:57:50,178 --> 00:57:51,540
So that's this part here.

667
00:57:53,341 --> 00:57:54,242
So now we're over here.

668
00:57:57,277 --> 00:58:03,164
Okay, so we finally, right, the oxygen's in the alveoli and it's diffusing into the blood.

669
00:58:04,146 --> 00:58:05,127
Where does it go in the blood?

670
00:58:06,168 --> 00:58:08,351
Does it just hang out with the red blood cells?

671
00:58:09,713 --> 00:58:11,935
Seeing some shakes, so where does it go?

672
00:58:11,935 --> 00:58:14,859
How do we transport oxygen in the body?

673
00:58:14,859 --> 00:58:21,627
I've kinda mentioned it a few times, but... It's a protein.

674
00:58:21,627 --> 00:58:22,568
Hemoglobin.

675
00:58:22,568 --> 00:58:22,868
Nice.

676
00:58:22,868 --> 00:58:23,349
Thank you.

677
00:58:23,349 --> 00:58:23,789
Thank you.

678
00:58:23,789 --> 00:58:29,696
So 99% of the oxygen that is transported is bound to hemoglobin.

679
00:58:32,118 --> 00:58:39,306
If a hemoglobin molecule has oxygen bound to it, we call it oxyhemoglobin.

680
00:58:39,306 --> 00:58:44,952
When hemoglobin or hemoglobin site does not have oxygen bound to it, we call it deoxyhemoglobin.

681
00:58:50,922 --> 00:58:56,850
Where do we think the other 1% of oxygen is being transported?

682
00:58:59,434 --> 00:59:00,795
So we have oxygen in the blood.

683
00:59:00,795 --> 00:59:06,864
99% of the oxygen that's in our blood, if we were to take a blood sample, is bound to hemoglobin.

684
00:59:06,864 --> 00:59:07,505
Where's the rest?

685
00:59:08,566 --> 00:59:09,728
Where's the other 1% going?

686
00:59:09,728 --> 00:59:15,816
It'd be part of the buffering system.

687
00:59:17,247 --> 00:59:20,191
Yeah, so I like where you're going with that, but where

688
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:23,456
would oxygen then either be bound to or not bound to something?

689
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:26,400
How are we transporting it?

690
00:59:29,525 --> 00:59:31,668
So it's stuck on some hemoglobin molecules.

691
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:35,674
That's 99% of the 100 partial pressure that we just looked at.

692
00:59:36,956 --> 00:59:38,438
So where's that other 1%?

693
00:59:38,438 --> 00:59:42,664
It is just floating, but where?

694
00:59:44,399 --> 00:59:45,320
It's in the plasma.

695
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,402
It's just like dissolved into the plasma, right?

696
00:59:48,303 --> 00:59:52,347
Like if you have a, I don't know, some people call it soda, some people call it pop, right?

697
00:59:52,347 --> 00:59:54,168
If you have a can and you shake it up and you just

698
00:59:54,168 --> 00:59:58,652
open it, well all of that kind of just diffuses out of the liquid in itself.

699
01:00:00,194 --> 01:00:03,377
So that's CO2, but O2 is dissolved into the plasma.

700
01:00:04,198 --> 01:00:08,041
So there is a small contribution of oxygen diffused into

701
01:00:08,041 --> 01:00:11,925
the plasma, but it's very, very, very little.

702
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:16,227
When we go through that formula, you'll see how small of a fraction it is.

703
01:00:17,672 --> 01:00:24,171
OK, so then the amount of oxygen that is transported is dependent on these three big factors here.

704
01:00:25,234 --> 01:00:27,180
One, hemoglobin concentration.

705
01:00:29,506 --> 01:00:34,433
So how many hemoglobin molecules do we have floating around inside of the blood?

706
01:00:35,334 --> 01:00:43,045
Then two, out of the hemoglobin molecules that we do have, how many are fully bound with oxygen?

707
01:00:44,447 --> 01:00:48,373
When we see them fully bound, we see an SpO2 of 100%.

708
01:00:48,373 --> 01:00:53,220
Then this small, right?

709
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:56,965
Very minor contribution, we have a small amount dissolved in the plasma.

710
01:01:08,217 --> 01:01:09,118
Any questions here?

711
01:01:10,339 --> 01:01:13,303
So these are three big factors here, try to keep those in mind.

712
01:01:14,664 --> 01:01:22,113
Even though it's a minor contribution, you can't forget about the amount dissolved in plasma.

713
01:01:22,113 --> 01:01:26,298
Okay, so this brings in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation

714
01:01:26,298 --> 01:01:31,143
curve, or the sometimes hemoglobin dissociation curve.

715
01:01:31,143 --> 01:01:35,068
I know you've seen this in physiology, but we're gonna bring it back because it's quite important.

716
01:01:36,179 --> 01:01:42,950
So the direction of the reaction does depend on the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood.

717
01:01:46,557 --> 01:01:52,146
It also depends on the affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen.

718
01:01:53,054 --> 01:01:55,197
There are different states of hemoglobin.

719
01:01:55,197 --> 01:01:57,982
We're not going to get into the exact chemical

720
01:01:57,982 --> 01:02:03,110
states that change during different pressure pressures and acidities and temperatures.

721
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:06,075
All you need to know is that there is a

722
01:02:06,075 --> 01:02:11,464
change in affinity for oxygen on these hemoglobin molecules depending on the situation.

723
01:02:11,464 --> 01:02:14,368
We'll go through those.

724
01:02:14,368 --> 01:02:18,555
So at the lung, a high partial pressure of oxygen

725
01:02:20,307 --> 01:02:25,254
encourages the formation of oxyhemoglobin.

726
01:02:26,636 --> 01:02:27,677
We call that loading.

727
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:32,925
So we're loading oxygen onto the hemoglobin molecules.

728
01:02:34,547 --> 01:02:41,096
At the tissues, in particular the skeletal muscle, there's a low partial pressure of oxygen.

729
01:02:42,618 --> 01:02:48,566
What is causing this decrease in partial pressure of oxygen?

730
01:02:48,566 --> 01:02:49,808
Who can help me out?

731
01:02:54,277 --> 01:02:56,794
It is relatively simple, or straightforward, I guess.

732
01:02:57,668 --> 01:02:59,050
Yeah, the tissues are using it.

733
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:01,793
So the mitochondria are consuming the oxygen at the

734
01:03:01,793 --> 01:03:05,136
electron transport chain, which then removes the oxygen.

735
01:03:05,136 --> 01:03:09,481
So there's a decrease in concentration or partial pressure oxygen at the mitochondria.

736
01:03:09,481 --> 01:03:14,246
That means there's a decreased pressure-pressure concentration of oxygen at the myoglobin.

737
01:03:14,246 --> 01:03:18,030
And so now, overall, next to the capillaries, it's lower

738
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:21,514
in the skeletal muscle compared to the capillaries.

739
01:03:21,514 --> 01:03:25,158
So we have this low partial pressure of oxygen

740
01:03:25,158 --> 01:03:26,600
at the tissues.

741
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:32,088
So that's going to encourage the hemoglobin molecules to drop off the oxygen at the tissues.

742
01:03:34,091 --> 01:03:36,434
So it's going to move down its concentration gradient.

743
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:44,005
Every time one oxygen molecule drops off, it starts

744
01:03:44,005 --> 01:03:51,176
reducing the affinity overall to the hemoglobin, and then they're a little bit easier to drop off.

745
01:03:51,176 --> 01:03:54,220
OK, here's that oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve

746
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:58,999
I would spend a decent amount of time here.

747
01:03:58,999 --> 01:04:02,143
So just make sure you understand what's going on on

748
01:04:02,143 --> 01:04:06,608
all these axes as well as different situations.

749
01:04:06,608 --> 01:04:09,071
Okay, we're gonna start with partial pressure of oxygen here.

750
01:04:11,394 --> 01:04:15,799
Notice how there really isn't a distinguishing factor of

751
01:04:15,799 --> 01:04:22,367
location, but this is the partial pressure of oxygen inside of the blood.

752
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:31,451
This is the percent hemoglobin saturation, or SAO2, so

753
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:36,257
saturation of the hemoglobin molecules in the arteries.

754
01:04:37,539 --> 01:04:41,424
Hemoglobin molecules are in the arteries, so that's why we say SAO2.

755
01:04:41,424 --> 01:04:44,849
If we say SPO2, that's pulse oximetry.

756
01:04:44,849 --> 01:04:46,511
That's like when you use a little light.

757
01:04:46,511 --> 01:04:48,134
You put that little thing on your finger.

758
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,776
That's SPO2.

759
01:04:49,776 --> 01:04:51,358
But this is SAO2 over here.

760
01:04:53,026 --> 01:05:04,857
OK, so if I see a partial pressure around 100 at sea level, it's a little bit lower at altitude.

761
01:05:04,857 --> 01:05:10,702
But at 100, based on what we talked about earlier, where are we as far as anatomical location?

762
01:05:14,866 --> 01:05:16,127
Who's brave enough?

763
01:05:16,127 --> 01:05:17,028
100.

764
01:05:17,028 --> 01:05:21,832
Where do we see that in the body in the context of what we were just talking about?

765
01:05:21,832 --> 01:05:22,813
Partial pressure of?

766
01:05:25,122 --> 01:05:26,584
Yeah, at the lungs.

767
01:05:26,584 --> 01:05:28,887
So when we're looking over here, this is usually at

768
01:05:28,887 --> 01:05:32,592
the lungs and kind of when it's being delivered to the rest of the body.

769
01:05:34,315 --> 01:05:35,016
Well, what about here?

770
01:05:35,016 --> 01:05:35,757
40.

771
01:05:35,757 --> 01:05:36,638
Well, that's interesting.

772
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:39,622
I know it says it up there, but where is that?

773
01:05:41,044 --> 01:05:42,186
Closer to the tissues, right?

774
01:05:42,186 --> 01:05:43,888
The venous blood.

775
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:50,772
So now that kind of gives us a little bit of an idea of how to maybe interpret this graph.

776
01:05:50,772 --> 01:05:55,719
The nice thing about this oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve is it's sigmoidal.

777
01:05:57,261 --> 01:06:00,405
What we mean by that is there's a really steep portion

778
01:06:00,405 --> 01:06:02,308
here and then there's a flat portion up here.

779
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:08,897
This is very, very important because the flat portion at

780
01:06:08,897 --> 01:06:16,979
the top allows us to have really big changes in the partial pressure of oxygen

781
01:06:16,979 --> 01:06:21,245
with very small changes in saturation.

782
01:06:23,108 --> 01:06:24,410
So let's say that again.

783
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:31,761
The flat portion allows us to have really big changes in the partial pressure of oxygen, right?

784
01:06:31,761 --> 01:06:35,888
So I can go from, I don't know, 70 to 110.

785
01:06:35,888 --> 01:06:40,675
This is a really big change in the partial pressure

786
01:06:40,675 --> 01:06:45,282
of oxygen with a very small change in saturation.

787
01:06:48,029 --> 01:06:50,293
And this is really nice for us to be able to

788
01:06:50,293 --> 01:06:55,040
defend against large changes in partial pressure when we go to different altitudes.

789
01:06:56,202 --> 01:06:58,926
So most of you, even though we're at a higher altitude than

790
01:06:58,926 --> 01:07:06,558
sea level, will still be at 99 to 100% saturation, even though you might be dropping down from 104 to 80.

791
01:07:06,558 --> 01:07:14,931
Okay, so the second part of the sigmoidal curve is we have this steep portion here.

792
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:21,244
That means we'll have small changes in partial pressure

793
01:07:21,244 --> 01:07:27,131
of oxygen with large changes in saturation.

794
01:07:30,214 --> 01:07:33,758
Again, the steep portion of this curve, I can have

795
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:40,586
small changes in the partial pressure of oxygen and that will result in large changes in the saturation.

796
01:07:43,068 --> 01:07:44,530
Why would I want that?

797
01:07:49,032 --> 01:07:52,716
I want to be as sensitive as possible to a small

798
01:07:52,716 --> 01:07:56,500
disturbance in the partial pressure of oxygen so I can just

799
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:02,106
dump off as much oxygen as possible any time the cells are utilizing oxygen.

800
01:08:04,449 --> 01:08:09,954
So that's pretty cool the way this hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve functions.

801
01:08:11,937 --> 01:08:18,904
And ironically enough, or just like what we talked about, this is venous blood.

802
01:08:20,048 --> 01:08:23,072
This is the partial pressure that we're typically experiencing,

803
01:08:23,072 --> 01:08:26,275
this 10 to 20 here, at the mitochondria.

804
01:08:27,817 --> 01:08:31,662
So if we're getting down into this or higher intensity exercise, right, like

805
01:08:31,662 --> 01:08:34,065
so if this is rest here and we're starting to get down

806
01:08:34,065 --> 01:08:38,470
here to exercise, we wanna be able to drop off a lot of oxygen.

807
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:44,497
We wanna encourage that oxygen to kinda drop off as quickly as possible.

808
01:08:44,497 --> 01:08:45,178
But,

809
01:08:46,407 --> 01:08:50,532
If we're having some issues at the lungs, so in this area

810
01:08:50,532 --> 01:08:54,436
over here, we want to be able to try to defend that

811
01:08:54,436 --> 01:08:58,341
as best as possible and have very small changes in saturation.

812
01:08:58,341 --> 01:09:02,025
We don't want to be offloading oxygen at the lungs.

813
01:09:03,146 --> 01:09:06,810
So we want to have that really flat portion of this dissociation curve.

814
01:09:11,275 --> 01:09:11,836
All right.

815
01:09:11,836 --> 01:09:12,577
How did I do?

816
01:09:12,577 --> 01:09:13,478
Any questions here?

817
01:09:18,368 --> 01:09:23,734
The last piece for this would be, I then can take the area of this curve.

818
01:09:23,734 --> 01:09:25,656
You don't need to do that, right?

819
01:09:25,656 --> 01:09:28,399
We need to rely on calculus and integrals.

820
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:30,201
But I could take this difference here.

821
01:09:31,963 --> 01:09:37,009
And this is the arterial venous over here.

822
01:09:37,009 --> 01:09:39,973
So arterial venous O2 difference.

823
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:41,915
What?

824
01:09:42,716 --> 01:09:43,857
The Fick equation?

825
01:09:43,857 --> 01:09:45,149
It's back?

826
01:09:45,149 --> 01:09:50,874
So arterial venous O2 difference is this difference right here.

827
01:09:52,996 --> 01:09:58,621
So during exercise, if the mixed venous VO2 or partial

828
01:09:58,621 --> 01:10:03,326
pressure of oxygen dips down here, well, then I'm going to shade a larger area.

829
01:10:03,326 --> 01:10:08,050
And that indicates that I've now just dropped off more oxygen into the tissues.

830
01:10:12,053 --> 01:10:13,755
It's pretty cool.

831
01:10:19,962 --> 01:10:24,292
All right, so this curve can shift to the right and the left.

832
01:10:24,292 --> 01:10:28,041
These are the three factors that we will start with on Tuesday.

833
01:10:29,223 --> 01:10:30,867
Have a good weekend.
