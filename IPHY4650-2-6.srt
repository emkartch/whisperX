1
00:02:02,864 --> 00:02:06,589
All right, let's get started here.

2
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:10,094
What a great day today, right?

3
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:16,344
It's like some of my, I guess, favorite days of the year or favorite time of the year.

4
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:21,311
The days are getting a little bit longer, there's more light out, it's warmer.

5
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:24,595
Such a good time, right, when some of you are graduating.

6
00:02:24,595 --> 00:02:25,937
It's a good semester.

7
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:33,222
Okay, so today we're gonna finish up hormonal responses to exercise.

8
00:02:33,222 --> 00:02:38,533
We finished up the kind of impact of the hormonal

9
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:46,730
responses during exercise and how that impacts substrate utilization in particular carbohydrates.

10
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,015
And then today we're going to move on to the fats.

11
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:51,667
But really quick before we do that,

12
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:57,612
We kind of have five or I guess four hormones if you kind of combine two of them.

13
00:02:57,612 --> 00:03:05,239
But as exercise intensity goes up and as duration gets longer, which hormones increase?

14
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:13,826
Who wants to help me out with that?

15
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:14,927
Yeah, catecholamines.

16
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,511
Yeah, norepinephrine, epinephrine.

17
00:03:18,511 --> 00:03:19,652
So we have those catecholamines.

18
00:03:20,672 --> 00:03:21,353
What else?

19
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:27,284
Yeah, everything except for insulin.

20
00:03:27,284 --> 00:03:30,871
So let's just add a curiosity, because we had the catecholamines.

21
00:03:30,871 --> 00:03:33,175
Someone else mentioned something else or had their hand up?

22
00:03:34,898 --> 00:03:35,579
Cortisol.

23
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:36,140
That's another one.

24
00:03:37,002 --> 00:03:37,823
So we have three of them now.

25
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:39,466
Growth hormone.

26
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:45,577
Say again?

27
00:03:45,577 --> 00:03:48,943
We'll get into that in a little bit, but that's not one of the ones we touched on.

28
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:51,801
Glucagon, good, nice.

29
00:03:51,801 --> 00:03:54,565
So we had those four hormones, or I guess five hormones

30
00:03:54,565 --> 00:03:59,272
going up, and then insulin goes down in both of those situations.

31
00:04:01,696 --> 00:04:04,039
And we kind of looked at the impact of what

32
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:11,330
those increasing and decreasing hormone do on carbohydrate metabolism.

33
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,695
Let's look and see how they're impacting fat metabolism.

34
00:04:16,261 --> 00:04:19,344
So just to make sure we're on the same page,

35
00:04:20,505 --> 00:04:25,450
what happens to fat utilization during prolonged submaximal exercise?

36
00:04:26,571 --> 00:04:28,813
Anyone wanna help me out with that?

37
00:04:28,813 --> 00:04:28,954
Yeah.

38
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:31,696
Say again?

39
00:04:32,497 --> 00:04:33,878
Increases, nice.

40
00:04:33,878 --> 00:04:39,364
So as fat utilization, or as exercise starts to increase

41
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:43,568
in duration, we increase in the fat utilization.

42
00:04:44,543 --> 00:04:50,052
and decrease in the carbohydrate utilization.

43
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:54,299
Okay, what about during graded exercise?

44
00:04:55,822 --> 00:05:00,449
So as exercise intensity increases, what happens to fat utilization?

45
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:02,172
You sure?

46
00:05:03,314 --> 00:05:04,556
Up, down?

47
00:05:04,556 --> 00:05:05,057
I'm just kidding.

48
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:08,522
Decreases, yeah, yeah, you gotta be confident.

49
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:10,686
Decreases.

50
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:18,234
So now that we kind of have this picture in the

51
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:23,461
back of our mind, we can start applying these concepts as

52
00:05:23,461 --> 00:05:28,528
far as how do hormones impact these two things here.

53
00:05:31,312 --> 00:05:33,695
Okay.

54
00:05:33,695 --> 00:05:34,857
So fat metabolism.

55
00:05:34,857 --> 00:05:41,266
Free fatty acid mobilization and fat metabolism is critical to endurance exercise performance.

56
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:44,888
As glycogen becomes more and more depleted,

57
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:53,035
we need to rely on our kind of unlimited energy source, which is fat or triglycerides.

58
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:02,303
If we are dealing with endurance performance, typically we're

59
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:08,728
thinking more in the realm or context of longer duration.

60
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:14,153
And so our body here,

61
00:06:15,702 --> 00:06:23,488
responds by increasing the hormones that are going to help accelerate the breakdown effect.

62
00:06:24,611 --> 00:06:26,337
And again, that term is lipolysis.

63
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:34,480
Just as a reminder, we go from triglycerides to free fatty acids and the glycerol.

64
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,225
The glycerol, we don't really use in energy kind of production.

65
00:06:39,225 --> 00:06:41,768
So we just focus on the free fatty acids.

66
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:46,133
The free fatty acids that need to be transported to the muscle.

67
00:06:47,234 --> 00:06:52,179
And then once we get to the muscle, how do we break down these free fatty acids?

68
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,602
Does anyone remember that term?

69
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,716
Well, so lipolysis gets us from triglycerides to free fatty acids.

70
00:07:02,716 --> 00:07:03,358
So I like that.

71
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:06,243
Beta oxidation.

72
00:07:06,243 --> 00:07:09,468
So we undergo those multiple turns of beta oxidation.

73
00:07:09,468 --> 00:07:11,692
And then we free up.

74
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:12,994
It's not on here.

75
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:15,318
The beta oxidation results in what?

76
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,562
What molecules do we get from there?

77
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,813
The exam is next week.

78
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:26,258
Acetyl-CoA, good.

79
00:07:26,258 --> 00:07:28,282
And then acetyl-CoA enters the Krebs cycle.

80
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:32,350
You go through that process, get the NADH, FADH, so you can get ATP.

81
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:34,715
So that's this piece here.

82
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,024
Any questions on that?

83
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,775
OK.

84
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:45,325
So.

85
00:07:45,325 --> 00:07:48,869
If we start back towards the top, lipolysis or that

86
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:54,696
breakdown of the triglyceride to the free fatty acid is stimulated

87
00:07:54,696 --> 00:07:59,662
by these kind of four or I guess five if you are separating these two.

88
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:02,425
So growth hormone, epinephrine, cortisol, and glucagon.

89
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:11,856
One thing to note here, insulin is an interesting hormone when it comes to lipolysis.

90
00:08:12,865 --> 00:08:16,050
If you have a higher concentration of insulin or you

91
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:25,404
just have insulin present at all, insulin is actually a potent or a very strong inhibitor of lipolysis.

92
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:33,916
So if you decrease the concentration of insulin, then you increase lipolysis.

93
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:42,228
So insulin is a potent inhibitor of lipolysis.

94
00:08:42,228 --> 00:08:47,234
So by removing insulin or decreasing insulin, you actually increase lipolysis.

95
00:08:49,677 --> 00:08:51,179
So that's what this decreased is here.

96
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:58,869
That's going to be a little important, especially when we talk about nutrition and feeding.

97
00:08:58,869 --> 00:09:01,833
Because typically when I eat something, what happens to insulin?

98
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:04,977
Spikes, right?

99
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:08,000
If you increase blood sugar, you kind of spite the insulin.

100
00:09:09,222 --> 00:09:09,282
OK.

101
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:15,358
So same, I guess, format as what we have done in

102
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:18,302
the past with carbohydrates, but I'm gonna move a little

103
00:09:18,302 --> 00:09:20,806
bit faster through here because again, it's the same picture.

104
00:09:22,047 --> 00:09:26,954
If I have growth hormone and it is stimulating lipolysis,

105
00:09:26,954 --> 00:09:30,959
we are acting on the adipose tissue to free up these

106
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:37,007
free fatty acids, glycerol too, but we're really more kind of concerned about these free fatty acids.

107
00:09:38,017 --> 00:09:41,901
Catecholamines also stimulate lipolysis, so it's gonna target

108
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:44,544
the adipose tissue, increase free fatty acid production.

109
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:49,489
Cortisol is doing the same thing here in the adipose tissue.

110
00:09:51,431 --> 00:09:53,554
And of course, glucagon doesn't wanna be left out of

111
00:09:53,554 --> 00:09:57,398
the party, so glucagon's gonna meet everyone at the adipose

112
00:09:57,398 --> 00:10:02,323
tissue and also help break down triglycerides to free up these free fatty acids.

113
00:10:06,327 --> 00:10:07,028
Are we okay there?

114
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,045
So then let's talk about this.

115
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:23,056
If all of these hormones are going up as

116
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:37,099
exercise intensity increases, and then insulin's going down, why do we see the crossover concept?

117
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:42,269
Everything we just talked about right now, exercise

118
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:45,633
intensity increases, these five hormones go up, or four,

119
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:49,438
again, catecholamines, those five hormones are going up.

120
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:53,924
I just told you all five of those are going to

121
00:10:53,924 --> 00:11:01,874
stimulate lipolysis, free up free fatty acids, and allow us to use those for substrate utilization.

122
00:11:04,017 --> 00:11:07,927
But we don't see that, right?

123
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:12,732
we see a decrease in the fat utilization.

124
00:11:15,756 --> 00:11:20,080
So without looking too far ahead on the slides, can anyone try to help me out with this?

125
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,925
Any thoughts, or maybe, yeah, anyone help me out with this?

126
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:27,248
I didn't wanna spend too much time on this.

127
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:30,652
Just because we're gonna go over it.

128
00:11:33,695 --> 00:11:37,039
Maybe some similar concepts of what we talked about with carbohydrates.

129
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:41,670
Say again, decrease.

130
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:47,135
Yeah, yeah, so that's one of the bigger factors, right?

131
00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:48,276
We're gonna talk about a few more.

132
00:11:49,277 --> 00:11:52,039
One of the biggest factors is as I increase in

133
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:56,403
exercise intensity, I need to redirect blood flow to the muscles.

134
00:11:58,004 --> 00:12:01,127
That is taking blood away from the adipose tissue.

135
00:12:01,127 --> 00:12:03,990
You could secrete all these hormones that you want, if

136
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:09,034
they don't have a mailbox to get into, they're not going to be able to send that signal.

137
00:12:10,803 --> 00:12:14,870
Okay, so that's one, we'll get into, there are a few other cool ones.

138
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:21,399
Just as a reminder, free fatty acid mobilization does depend on hormone-sensitive lipase.

139
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,440
This is not the only one.

140
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,107
We usually categorize them as lipases, but this is a very important one.

141
00:12:27,107 --> 00:12:30,231
Please do not worry about these mechanisms here.

142
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:32,815
Basically, it's saying a hormone binds to a receptor,

143
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:38,883
causes some secondary messenger systems or some G protein-linked activation here.

144
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:42,089
You're gonna break down triglycerides into free fatty acids.

145
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:45,317
We just already talked about that, so don't worry about these details here.

146
00:12:47,443 --> 00:12:54,120
What we do wanna focus on are the factors that are impairing free fatty acid mobilization.

147
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,403
We're gonna talk about four of them.

148
00:12:56,486 --> 00:12:58,120
Number one.

149
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,848
Elevated hydrogen concentration inhibits hormone-sensitive lipase.

150
00:13:03,848 --> 00:13:06,933
Well, if I just showed you that hormone-sensitive lipase

151
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:11,800
is extremely important in breaking down triglycerides, but I

152
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,607
then inhibit that lipase or that enzyme, well, now I'm gonna

153
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:21,955
have a harder time freeing up free fatty acids.

154
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:27,972
Number two, high levels of lactic acid or lactate

155
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:32,398
promotes the resynthesis of triglycerides.

156
00:13:32,398 --> 00:13:36,063
So if we're looking at figure B down here on the left with this green circle,

157
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:43,834
here I have lactate entering in the adipose tissue, and

158
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:49,182
because of that, you have an interaction that actually helps the formation of triglycerides.

159
00:13:51,385 --> 00:13:55,971
So it's going reverse of what we really want as far as mobilizing free fatty acids.

160
00:13:57,976 --> 00:14:02,881
Here, if you're looking at these, some of these interactions with these hormones,

161
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:07,706
but this one in particular, right, so the hormones are gonna increase hormone-sensitive lipase,

162
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:12,532
but we also have this funny little ion over here, so

163
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:20,240
we have this hydrogen that has this negative sign here, and the negative sign is implying inhibiting.

164
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,806
So it's inhibiting this hormone-sensitive lipase, so it's preventing this arrow from occurring.

165
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,681
And when we get into respiratory physiology, we know that

166
00:14:34,681 --> 00:14:38,585
as we get to higher intensity exercise, we actually produce quite

167
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:44,352
a bit or a lot of hydrogen ions, especially due to the bicarb buffering.

168
00:14:44,352 --> 00:14:47,776
So these hydrogen ions are gonna outweigh some of

169
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:52,642
the impact of the other hormones on hormone-sensitive lipase.

170
00:14:57,087 --> 00:14:58,088
On the right here,

171
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,022
So this isn't enough, right?

172
00:15:02,022 --> 00:15:03,783
I can't just say lactate goes here.

173
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:05,125
Let's do an experiment.

174
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:11,911
So on the right here for this figure A, on the x-axis, they have lactic acid or lactate.

175
00:15:13,132 --> 00:15:16,875
And then on the y-axis, they have free fatty acids.

176
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,659
And as far as the y goes, you can think of it as mobilization, right?

177
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:22,460
The more free fatty acids you have, the more

178
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,923
you're breaking down triglycerides, the less you're breaking down triglycerides.

179
00:15:26,904 --> 00:15:28,286
First, let's look at the blue.

180
00:15:28,286 --> 00:15:29,847
The blue is exercise.

181
00:15:32,155 --> 00:15:35,540
As we exercise, we produce more lactate.

182
00:15:36,722 --> 00:15:38,264
And it looks like that trend's going down.

183
00:15:39,686 --> 00:15:41,469
But then someone can say, well, what if there's

184
00:15:41,469 --> 00:15:47,338
something else going on in exercise producing lactic acid or lactate, right?

185
00:15:47,338 --> 00:15:54,569
Or what if something else is causing the free fatty acid to go down besides lactate?

186
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:55,050
Well, look at this.

187
00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:01,099
They did a really cool experiment where they actually infused lactate without any exercise.

188
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:08,038
They even got concentrations twice as high as what

189
00:16:08,038 --> 00:16:10,984
someone experienced at the highest intensity exercise.

190
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:18,960
And even down here, we saw even further of a decrease

191
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,227
in these free fatty acid levels in the blood.

192
00:16:24,755 --> 00:16:29,240
So from this experiment, they pretty much identified some mechanisms,

193
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,523
but they have kind of gave us this information of this

194
00:16:32,523 --> 00:16:38,529
piece here, where we are not producing as many free fatty acids inside of the body.

195
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:41,112
If anything, we are producing more triglycerides, or we

196
00:16:41,112 --> 00:16:43,914
are encouraging the formation of those triglycerides.

197
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:46,877
It's pretty cool.

198
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,480
OK.

199
00:16:52,818 --> 00:16:55,161
We doing okay on factors one and two?

200
00:16:58,286 --> 00:17:00,188
All right, let's go to three and four.

201
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:05,415
Three, inadequate blood flow to the adipose tissue, which one of your classmates had mentioned.

202
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:11,083
And then number four, if I, let's just theoretically say

203
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:15,802
I release all the free fatty acids from the triglycerides, well,

204
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:22,769
We still cannot go against the fact that these free fatty acids are hydrophilic, right?

205
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:25,973
They don't like water, and so they need some sort of

206
00:17:25,973 --> 00:17:28,375
transport or protein to get it down to the muscle.

207
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:34,722
If I don't have enough albumin to transport the free fatty acids in the plasma,

208
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:37,725
well, then that's gonna be a really big problem when

209
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:41,809
we're trying to use free fatty acids for energy production.

210
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:55,420
And because of that, we see this trend here, where

211
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:03,856
as we increase in exercise intensity, we see free fatty acid mobilization and utilization go down.

212
00:18:08,905 --> 00:18:12,670
This is in addition to what we talked about before.

213
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,053
where it just takes much longer.

214
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:20,340
So the amount of energy we can generate per second from fats is much slower.

215
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:25,626
And the RER concept, where the caloric equivalent is much lower in fats.

216
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:33,396
So now we kind of have a good database of mechanisms that are explaining this decrease here.

217
00:18:41,105 --> 00:18:43,289
If there are no questions then we can move on

218
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:47,396
from substrate utilization and get into plasma volume during exercise.

219
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:51,963
Okay, just as a reminder, because I know for some of

220
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:54,528
you it might have been a little bit since you've had physiology,

221
00:18:54,528 --> 00:18:59,127
but if I take a blood sample, a venous blood sample from you,

222
00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:01,310
you would see whole blood, and then I put that in

223
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:07,038
a centrifuge, spin it down, you eventually will get a solution that looks like this.

224
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:09,882
You'll have blood, that white, buffy coat, which will

225
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:13,146
have the platelets, white blood cells, and then you would have your plasma here.

226
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:21,658
So during exercise, we see decreases in plasma volume.

227
00:19:23,191 --> 00:19:28,362
Yes, blood volume also goes down, but we're actually not losing the red blood cells.

228
00:19:28,362 --> 00:19:29,865
We're losing this plasma here.

229
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:37,621
One of the biggest kind of drivers in that decrease in

230
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:43,714
plasma volume is due to this increase in hydrostatic pressure and tissue osmotic pressure.

231
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:48,653
Now, I know they have this in physiology.

232
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:50,736
So can someone explain to me what this is?

233
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:53,420
What's hydrostatic pressure and tissue osmotic pressure?

234
00:19:57,726 --> 00:19:59,529
I know it's going way back to physiology, but.

235
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:03,775
Is it hydrostatic pressure?

236
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:06,799
I think it's like the pressure of the blood, again,

237
00:20:08,585 --> 00:20:12,389
Yeah, yeah, so it's the pressure of the blood itself

238
00:20:12,389 --> 00:20:15,613
against the epithelial cells and the blood vessels.

239
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:18,436
You can think of it if I have a balloon and I

240
00:20:18,436 --> 00:20:24,643
just squeeze on that balloon and the water's kind of expanding the balloon, that's that hydrostatic pressure.

241
00:20:24,643 --> 00:20:28,787
It's the actual pressure of the water itself exerting on the blood vessel walls.

242
00:20:29,588 --> 00:20:31,310
Okay, what about osmotic pressure?

243
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,875
Whoa, haven't heard that word in a while.

244
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,834
Osmotic pressure.

245
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:42,355
Any ideas?

246
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:43,797
Yeah.

247
00:20:53,489 --> 00:20:59,015
Yeah, yeah, it's basically, you notice the word, it's very close to osmosis.

248
00:21:00,037 --> 00:21:05,203
Water likes to move from high concentration, right, from low concentration to high concentration.

249
00:21:06,618 --> 00:21:09,385
So typically you have an imbalance in the number of

250
00:21:09,385 --> 00:21:14,117
ions and molecules in your blood versus the interstitial fluid.

251
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:18,167
And so water kind of seeps out in that manner.

252
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:24,792
Both of these things kind of change as we exercise and we lose some plasma volume.

253
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:27,916
Sweating, this one's a little controversial.

254
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:33,903
So I know the idea is that we always lose plasma volume or blood volume from sweating.

255
00:21:33,903 --> 00:21:37,388
That might not be the most accurate statement.

256
00:21:37,388 --> 00:21:40,491
We lose a lot of total body water, but

257
00:21:40,491 --> 00:21:43,695
because of this hydrostatic pressure tissue, osmotic pressure, sometimes

258
00:21:43,695 --> 00:21:47,303
we can kind of protect it a little bit.

259
00:21:47,303 --> 00:21:49,225
So total body water changes for sure.

260
00:21:50,086 --> 00:21:53,410
If I hadn't put an asterisk on one of these three, you'd be on this sweating piece.

261
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,533
And then the last one is heat strain and decrease in blood pressure.

262
00:21:58,075 --> 00:22:02,079
So these two kind of go hand in hand here.

263
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,202
Okay, so we don't want that decrease in plasma volume.

264
00:22:06,524 --> 00:22:09,507
If we decrease plasma volume or blood volume, we're getting

265
00:22:09,507 --> 00:22:13,271
a decrease in the cardiac output or the stroke volume.

266
00:22:13,271 --> 00:22:16,855
If I decrease stroke volume from the Fick equation, what else goes down?

267
00:22:21,695 --> 00:22:23,357
Or how about what is the Fick equation?

268
00:22:30,065 --> 00:22:35,612
Yeah, stroke volume times heart rate equals cardiac output times what?

269
00:22:40,879 --> 00:22:42,000
So close.

270
00:22:43,022 --> 00:22:46,406
That gets into mean RTL pressure, but we're looking more

271
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:50,045
on the AVO2 difference, which gives us VO2 max.

272
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:50,546
Right.

273
00:22:50,546 --> 00:22:53,392
So for reducing the amount of blood flow that's being pumped

274
00:22:53,392 --> 00:22:55,736
out of the heart or blood in the body, then we're reducing

275
00:22:55,736 --> 00:22:58,121
the amount of blood that's kind of being pumped out of the heart.

276
00:22:58,121 --> 00:23:01,167
And so we don't want this drop in plasma volume because

277
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:05,034
we want to be able to deliver more oxygen to the tissues, especially during exercise.

278
00:23:05,876 --> 00:23:08,982
So hormones then can correct this fluid imbalance.

279
00:23:12,202 --> 00:23:15,086
Let's start with the first hormone vasopressin.

280
00:23:15,086 --> 00:23:21,614
Sometimes we call this antidiuretic hormone or AVP arginine vasopressin.

281
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,804
You basically really just kinda need to focus on in

282
00:23:29,804 --> 00:23:34,530
the hypothalamus we are sending some type of signal to the

283
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:38,175
brain which then causes the release of this hormone.

284
00:23:39,337 --> 00:23:43,043
This signal in the brain is typically a drop in plasma volume.

285
00:23:45,187 --> 00:23:49,153
Yes, you have some other ones like drop in blood pressure and things like that.

286
00:23:49,153 --> 00:23:53,079
But essentially, you're sending that signal to the hypothalamus.

287
00:23:54,241 --> 00:23:56,825
Don't worry about all these steps here.

288
00:23:56,825 --> 00:24:00,872
And of course, these are accessory organs for other hormones.

289
00:24:02,827 --> 00:24:06,411
So drop in mean arterial pressure, drop in blood volume

290
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:11,837
is going to cause the release of this hormone, vasopressin,

291
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:17,524
and then hopefully we're gonna get this water retention or reabsorption

292
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:22,149
in the kidneys, and we can get this conservation of blood volume.

293
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,998
Okay, so what is the mechanism?

294
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:34,124
What do these hormones actually target?

295
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:35,266
Which cells do they target?

296
00:24:36,127 --> 00:24:39,091
And in particular, they are targeting some cells in the kidney.

297
00:24:40,013 --> 00:24:45,060
So vasopression is enhancing water reabsorption by the kidneys.

298
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:50,248
So we've already kind of filtered this out, and then we're gonna reabsorb that water back in.

299
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,927
It's a pretty cool way that vasopressin does this.

300
00:24:56,927 --> 00:25:01,874
So we have this vasopressin, or anti-diuretic hormone, that's what it's labeled right here.

301
00:25:01,874 --> 00:25:03,696
It's gonna bind on this receptor.

302
00:25:04,678 --> 00:25:07,261
This receptor is gonna cause some type of signaling

303
00:25:07,261 --> 00:25:13,129
cascade, which is gonna result in the translocation of these water transporters.

304
00:25:13,951 --> 00:25:16,688
They are called aquaporin.

305
00:25:16,688 --> 00:25:21,113
So these specialized transporters called aquaporin allow for the

306
00:25:21,113 --> 00:25:25,038
movement of water from one area to the other.

307
00:25:28,822 --> 00:25:33,728
So again, vasopressin or anti-diuretic hormone is targeting cells

308
00:25:33,728 --> 00:25:43,219
in the kidney to cause the aquaporin to allow for reabsorption of water back into the bloodstream.

309
00:25:49,763 --> 00:25:50,524
Any questions here?

310
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:59,232
During acute created exercise, no surprise, as we increase

311
00:25:59,232 --> 00:26:14,225
in exercise intensity, we see a large increase in the secretion or the concentration of vasopressin.

312
00:26:14,225 --> 00:26:17,188
Okay, hormone number two, aldosterone.

313
00:26:18,147 --> 00:26:23,596
Aldosterone is secreted in the adrenal glands or from the adrenal glands.

314
00:26:23,596 --> 00:26:27,543
It is also produced in response to a drop in blood volume.

315
00:26:29,346 --> 00:26:33,593
That drop in blood volume causes the release of aldosterone

316
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:40,324
and then eventually we are gonna try to increase this plasma volume and blood volume.

317
00:26:46,885 --> 00:26:47,986
Okay, how is it doing it?

318
00:26:49,488 --> 00:26:52,030
Also targeting cells in the kidney.

319
00:26:53,772 --> 00:26:57,635
But aldosterone is a little different than antidiuretic hormone.

320
00:26:59,177 --> 00:27:03,281
Instead of causing the translocation of these aquaporin

321
00:27:03,281 --> 00:27:10,668
transporters, it actually increases the uptake of sodium.

322
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,913
If I move a bunch of sodium across the membrane,

323
00:27:17,294 --> 00:27:24,402
the osmotic pressure inside of this interstitial fluid in the blood start to increase.

324
00:27:25,784 --> 00:27:28,827
Well, water's gonna follow that change or that increase

325
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:32,231
in osmotic pressure, and you have that movement of water osmosis.

326
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:41,682
Similarly, with acute

327
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:51,749
Graded exercise, so as exercise intensity increases, we get a large increase in aldosterone.

328
00:27:51,749 --> 00:27:55,073
So if I were to summarize this during high intensity

329
00:27:55,073 --> 00:28:02,400
exercise as well as duration, I get aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone increases.

330
00:28:03,602 --> 00:28:10,289
Both of those hormones are gonna increase the retention or kind of the reabsorption of water.

331
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,779
But they do it in two different ways.

332
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:15,102
Antidiuretic hormone does it by aquapor.

333
00:28:16,744 --> 00:28:22,250
And then aldosterone is doing it by sodium kind of reabsorption and osmosis that way.

334
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:30,680
Okay.

335
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:36,766
Ultimately, these hormones going up during exercise, what is the goal again?

336
00:28:36,766 --> 00:28:37,768
What are we trying to increase?

337
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:39,850
Plasma volume.

338
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:44,917
So during exercise, when we see the highest concentration

339
00:28:44,917 --> 00:28:47,280
of these two hormones, what should we expect to see

340
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,346
again with exercise as duration increases in plasma volume?

341
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:58,537
It should go, if I have a high concentration of

342
00:28:58,537 --> 00:29:01,301
aldosterone and vasopressin in the body based on what we

343
00:29:01,301 --> 00:29:07,390
just talked about during exercise, what should we see happen with plasma volume?

344
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:15,358
Yeah, balance or even go up, right?

345
00:29:15,358 --> 00:29:17,902
Because the whole goal of all of these is to reabsorb water.

346
00:29:21,628 --> 00:29:23,551
It's never that simple though, right?

347
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:26,015
Okay, let's look at this graph.

348
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:30,483
Change in plasma volume on the Y, left Y. Change

349
00:29:30,483 --> 00:29:36,682
in aldosterone concentration, but we also know that vasopressin does the same thing.

350
00:29:36,682 --> 00:29:41,426
on the why we're looking at the duration, so change in duration.

351
00:29:41,426 --> 00:29:42,767
Aldosterone is this blue one.

352
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:45,270
No surprise, aldosterone's going up.

353
00:29:47,592 --> 00:29:48,733
We've already established that.

354
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:51,715
Wait a minute.

355
00:29:53,657 --> 00:29:59,763
Plasma volume goes down, still going down, still going down, and still going down.

356
00:30:03,806 --> 00:30:04,647
That's weird.

357
00:30:06,213 --> 00:30:09,822
Does that just mean aldosterone's useless?

358
00:30:15,136 --> 00:30:15,437
Say again?

359
00:30:18,405 --> 00:30:19,928
Does it have to do with anything with sweating?

360
00:30:19,928 --> 00:30:20,931
Is that what you were thinking?

361
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:24,805
A little bit, right, like that first slide I

362
00:30:24,805 --> 00:30:27,868
showed you, everything's going down because of potentially

363
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:30,570
maybe sweating or hydrostatic pressure and things like that.

364
00:30:31,711 --> 00:30:34,494
But the whole job of these two hormones is to bring it

365
00:30:34,494 --> 00:30:36,656
back up or maybe even prevent it from going down.

366
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,601
Why isn't it working?

367
00:30:46,365 --> 00:30:47,626
It's kind of the same thing.

368
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:51,610
Where does all the blood wanna go during exercise?

369
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:53,263
the muscles.

370
00:30:54,746 --> 00:30:58,112
The only way you could produce urine is if I send

371
00:30:58,112 --> 00:31:01,317
blood to the kidneys so the kidneys can filter out the urine.

372
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,511
If it then filters out the blood to produce urine, well,

373
00:31:09,511 --> 00:31:13,378
now I need to pull back whatever water I can in there.

374
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:20,379
During exercise, you actually don't produce a lot of urine.

375
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:24,447
So there's nothing really to get back in that process.

376
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:30,758
So we have a huge limitation as far as the ability

377
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:36,649
to reabsorb something that doesn't even have a high concentration or a high mountain in the first place.

378
00:31:37,844 --> 00:31:39,546
And you've probably noticed this, right?

379
00:31:39,546 --> 00:31:43,652
Unless you chug two liters of water before you exercise.

380
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:46,637
But typically, if you're in a comfortable state and

381
00:31:46,637 --> 00:31:51,263
you go exercise, you could probably exercise for quite a long time without having to use the bathroom.

382
00:31:53,126 --> 00:31:58,053
And then afterwards, though, that's when maybe things start to change.

383
00:32:00,156 --> 00:32:03,501
And so the question would be, well, why do we secrete all of these things?

384
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:06,265
Well, the body does not kind of

385
00:32:07,105 --> 00:32:09,588
determine what situation you're in.

386
00:32:09,588 --> 00:32:14,014
The hypothalamus is just reacting to the decrease in

387
00:32:14,014 --> 00:32:18,820
plasma volume, so it's just gonna keep secreting it until plasma volume goes back up.

388
00:32:19,701 --> 00:32:23,305
So you have these high concentration of these hormones when you're exercising.

389
00:32:24,587 --> 00:32:27,831
And the most important piece for these would be

390
00:32:27,831 --> 00:32:32,016
after you're done exercising and you start rehydrating.

391
00:32:32,907 --> 00:32:38,857
That's when you're going to start really getting this impact for these type of hormones.

392
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:44,606
During exercise, they do very little to no change in plasma point, as we saw before.

393
00:32:49,374 --> 00:32:50,576
Are we OK with this concept?

394
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:58,000
So during exercise, aldosterone, basopressin,

395
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,887
not really helping too much with the plasma volume retention or kind of attenuation of that drop.

396
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:10,833
However, after exercise, when we start rehydrating, that's

397
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:13,036
when it's gonna really help increase blood volume.

398
00:33:14,918 --> 00:33:20,403
This is why, after repeated bouts of endurance training, there are other factors too.

399
00:33:21,504 --> 00:33:24,708
Athletes typically have a higher blood volume compared

400
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:27,970
to recreationally active individuals of sedentary.

401
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:30,653
because they are continuously undergoing this peace and

402
00:33:30,653 --> 00:33:33,996
your body's starting to increase blood volume over time.

403
00:33:46,168 --> 00:33:52,695
No, yeah, yeah, it's just because, yeah, there's nothing to reabsorb from the kidneys, yeah.

404
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,784
So as you are filtering, once it's in the bladder, it's in the bladder, it's gone.

405
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,687
Like, if you already have urine in the bladder, you're done.

406
00:33:59,687 --> 00:34:03,531
But as you are producing the urine, before it gets to

407
00:34:03,531 --> 00:34:06,094
the bladder, you're kind of pulling as much water out as possible.

408
00:34:07,156 --> 00:34:09,178
But if I'm not even sending blood to the kidneys for

409
00:34:09,178 --> 00:34:15,686
it to be filtered in the first place, there's not a whole lot you can do from there.

410
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:15,826
Yeah.

411
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:18,649
How does that work with, like, fueling the blood?

412
00:34:21,363 --> 00:34:27,091
Yeah, so that gets into a different conversation, which we'll get into in thermoregulation.

413
00:34:27,091 --> 00:34:30,276
But typically, when you sweat, you lose a lot of electrolytes.

414
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,479
And that's where you get this idea of, hey, we

415
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:36,965
need to replenish some of those electrolytes, as well as total body water.

416
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:39,649
So total body water is much different than blood volume.

417
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:44,296
And that becomes a big problem if we become dehydrated.

418
00:34:44,296 --> 00:34:47,883
So dehydration is usually reserved for total body water

419
00:34:47,883 --> 00:34:51,631
loss, not necessarily blood volume loss, although they sometimes go hand in hand.

420
00:34:54,957 --> 00:34:57,242
Great question.

421
00:34:58,424 --> 00:35:02,372
Yeah.

422
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,848
Yeah, so the question was, does your body struggle to take on water?

423
00:35:07,848 --> 00:35:11,094
Not necessarily if it gets into your body, but most

424
00:35:11,094 --> 00:35:16,064
people can't handle drinking water and the discomfort that comes with it.

425
00:35:16,064 --> 00:35:20,513
So if you drink water, as long as the environment is

426
00:35:20,513 --> 00:35:23,940
good, you will absorb that water into the body.

427
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,623
However, if I start

428
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:29,751
Like drinking 500 milliliters of fluid at high intensity

429
00:35:29,751 --> 00:35:34,800
exercise, most people will not enjoy that feeling and maybe sometimes throw up or they have to slow down.

430
00:35:48,386 --> 00:35:49,107
Yeah.

431
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:49,298
OK.

432
00:35:49,298 --> 00:35:52,307
That moves us on to chapter six.

433
00:35:52,307 --> 00:35:59,862
This will be the last chapter that you will see on your lecture exam next Thursday.

434
00:35:59,862 --> 00:36:02,405
Just a quick update on that.

435
00:36:02,405 --> 00:36:08,652
So it's, I haven't finished it just yet, but there's around 33 questions, all multiple choice.

436
00:36:09,654 --> 00:36:15,881
I highly recommend you bring a calculator because there will be calculations on this lecture exam.

437
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:19,826
You don't necessarily need the calculator, but in my opinion

438
00:36:19,826 --> 00:36:25,212
I would, like why deal with that stress of mental math when you have a calculator?

439
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:32,529
If it requires an equation, it will be on the front page of the exam.

440
00:36:32,529 --> 00:36:35,754
You do not need to memorize any equations.

441
00:36:35,754 --> 00:36:39,400
So I have this, not everyone agrees with me, but I

442
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:45,890
have a school of thought of nowadays you can look up any equation on Google.

443
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:50,137
So I feel like I shouldn't really test you to memorize those equations.

444
00:36:50,137 --> 00:36:52,006
You just need to know how to use them.

445
00:36:52,006 --> 00:36:56,255
Because in life, you can just Google, like, what's the equation for this?

446
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,279
But not everyone knows how to use it.

447
00:36:58,279 --> 00:37:01,165
Conversion factors will also be given if we use it, right?

448
00:37:01,165 --> 00:37:01,586
Yeah, yeah.

449
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:05,053
But like, I mean, I'm not going to give you like minutes to seconds.

450
00:37:05,053 --> 00:37:10,124
But like, yeah, like feet to meters or something like that or things.

451
00:37:10,124 --> 00:37:12,208
Yeah, like some of the non-basic ones.

452
00:37:16,424 --> 00:37:19,748
Yeah, no practice exam, but the learning goals and

453
00:37:19,748 --> 00:37:21,730
the clicker questions are probably the best way.

454
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:25,754
I have a few review clicker questions that we'll use

455
00:37:25,754 --> 00:37:28,537
on Tuesday, because I don't think we're going to get through all of this.

456
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:31,941
So obviously, we're not going to have a full lecture on

457
00:37:31,941 --> 00:37:35,404
Tuesday, but I will reserve the end of class for some

458
00:37:35,404 --> 00:37:39,649
review clicker questions that are a little bit harder than what you've normally seen.

459
00:37:39,649 --> 00:37:44,254
Plus, I'm happy to answer any questions for the previous materials.

460
00:37:48,588 --> 00:37:52,392
As far as mechanisms go, you've obviously introduced a lot of mechanisms,

461
00:37:52,392 --> 00:37:54,975
but I feel like for the majority of them, you said

462
00:37:54,975 --> 00:37:57,897
that you don't really expect us to know the certain mechanisms.

463
00:37:57,897 --> 00:38:00,740
Which ones would you say we should prioritize?

464
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:05,745
So a good example would be the hormones in some of these immune mechanisms.

465
00:38:05,745 --> 00:38:10,550
You don't need to know how the secondary messenger

466
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:18,507
system or secondary cascade is responding or reacting to the hormone to get the response.

467
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:21,550
Instead, you need to know hormone, what the response

468
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:26,374
is, and then what implications should you know for exercise.

469
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:38,586
But mechanisms like hormones impacting substrate utilization, you should know that.

470
00:38:38,586 --> 00:38:45,072
So I could theoretically ask you a question on why

471
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,945
certain hormones or certain processes are causing fat

472
00:38:49,945 --> 00:38:52,890
utilization to decrease during intense exercise.

473
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,914
And we just talked about those four factors, hydrogen,

474
00:38:55,914 --> 00:38:59,259
lactate, blood flow, transport proteins of human.

475
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:04,827
But all multiple choice.

476
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,292
Sometimes that's good, sometimes that's bad.

477
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:16,662
Okay, exercise and the immune system, very similar to endocrinology.

478
00:39:16,662 --> 00:39:18,765
We don't go into depth at all.

479
00:39:18,765 --> 00:39:21,870
We just cover a basic, broad overview of what the immune

480
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:26,718
system is and does, and then we relate a lot of the exercise pieces.

481
00:39:26,718 --> 00:39:30,564
So details on the immune system, those are things that

482
00:39:30,564 --> 00:39:33,569
I would recommend not spending a ton of time on, but you

483
00:39:33,569 --> 00:39:37,435
still need to understand the basics so we can apply them to exercise physiology.

484
00:39:39,575 --> 00:39:41,699
Okay, overview of the immune system is where we're

485
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:46,689
gonna start, then exercise in the immune system, acute versus chronic.

486
00:39:46,689 --> 00:39:50,295
We'll talk about upper respiratory tract infections,

487
00:39:50,295 --> 00:39:53,381
and then exercising in environmental extremes.

488
00:39:54,524 --> 00:39:58,491
And of course, we'll start and end with this common

489
00:39:58,491 --> 00:40:01,617
question, should you exercise when you have a cold?

490
00:40:02,558 --> 00:40:04,204
So again, we'll start with this.

491
00:40:04,204 --> 00:40:08,178
I'm curious what we think here, and then we'll go through the material and ask it again.

492
00:40:08,178 --> 00:40:12,653
And sometimes we get changes, sometimes we don't.

493
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:15,679
Okay, let's take 15 seconds or so, just so you can get an answer in.

494
00:41:19,624 --> 00:41:21,926
Anyone need more time getting set up with their clicker?

495
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,952
Okay, I'll close this up in five seconds.

496
00:41:29,515 --> 00:41:32,218
Three, two, one.

497
00:41:35,236 --> 00:41:40,222
Okay, we'll come back to this after we go over all of the slides here.

498
00:41:41,364 --> 00:41:43,446
But overview of the immune system.

499
00:41:44,828 --> 00:41:50,575
So just to add, if you're curious, we're actually split 50-50 down there, yes and no.

500
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:53,919
But let's see, because it kinda depends.

501
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,282
But overview of the immune system.

502
00:41:57,663 --> 00:42:01,127
The immune system, again in a broad context, is just

503
00:42:01,127 --> 00:42:08,536
a mechanism for the body to protect against invasions or foreign particles, pathogens.

504
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:15,304
These pathogens or foreign agents can be parasites, viruses, bacteria, fungi.

505
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:20,110
There are a lot of them, but these are some examples.

506
00:42:22,638 --> 00:42:26,824
We as humans have three major levels of defense.

507
00:42:26,824 --> 00:42:30,949
We have anatomical barriers, which is the physical barriers

508
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:34,714
that are kind of separating the environment from the internal body.

509
00:42:36,096 --> 00:42:39,160
Skin mucus membranes are great examples.

510
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:44,067
Some of those membranes would be found even in the respiratory tract.

511
00:42:44,067 --> 00:42:50,363
So sometimes we forget that inside the alveoli of our lungs,

512
00:42:50,363 --> 00:42:54,310
There's a fluid that helps protect against pathogens.

513
00:42:57,376 --> 00:42:59,680
Then we have two other levels of defense.

514
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,485
We have something called the innate immunity.

515
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:09,317
And so for this one, we kind of are born with it.

516
00:43:10,715 --> 00:43:15,782
And these are some cells that are associated with the innate immune system.

517
00:43:15,782 --> 00:43:19,288
You do not need to memorize these, but the natural

518
00:43:19,288 --> 00:43:25,096
killer cell, as well as these cells, are associated with the innate immune system.

519
00:43:25,096 --> 00:43:27,700
The reason why I bring this up is if I talk about

520
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:33,809
macrophages, then you can kind of go back and be like, oh, wait, is that innate or adaptive?

521
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:36,553
And then you can come back to here and be like, oh, OK, it's innate.

522
00:43:40,178 --> 00:43:43,242
What the innate system does pretty much, there are a few

523
00:43:43,242 --> 00:43:47,027
things it does, but one of them is something called phagocytosis.

524
00:43:47,027 --> 00:43:50,612
And so what it's doing is I have a macrophage

525
00:43:50,612 --> 00:44:01,527
that pretty much ingests your pathogen, kind of breaks it down and discards it for kind of waste removal.

526
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:08,076
Macrophages and neutrophils are the ones that undergo phagocytosis.

527
00:44:12,494 --> 00:44:16,862
Another innate immune system cell would be or kind of

528
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:20,128
mechanism to deal with pathogens would be apoptosis.

529
00:44:22,152 --> 00:44:26,039
So natural killer cells can actually go to these infected

530
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:33,493
cells and cause it to undergo apoptosis with his like a programmed cell death.

531
00:44:33,493 --> 00:44:36,038
It basically tells it to self-destruct.

532
00:44:38,633 --> 00:44:41,360
This is kind of important because we're going to talk about

533
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,746
this later on when we get into muscle physiology.

534
00:44:44,588 --> 00:44:52,508
But apoptosis is the kind of programmed cell death that happens naturally inside of our cells.

535
00:44:56,909 --> 00:44:59,673
Another system would be the complement system.

536
00:44:59,673 --> 00:45:01,496
So this one's actually pretty cool.

537
00:45:01,496 --> 00:45:06,765
So we get some complement proteins that tag the surface of the pathogen.

538
00:45:06,765 --> 00:45:08,828
In this example, we're looking at a bacteria.

539
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:14,577
Once you tag these, then you get some other

540
00:45:14,577 --> 00:45:17,702
innate immune system cells to go in there.

541
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:24,614
In this example here, it's causing, it's like poking holes in

542
00:45:24,614 --> 00:45:27,639
the cell, and then it causes it to kind of destroy.

543
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:40,109
The next one would be acute inflammation.

544
00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:44,113
So this is usually in response to injury.

545
00:45:44,113 --> 00:45:45,975
So we get a cut on our finger.

546
00:45:45,975 --> 00:45:49,299
We get exposed to some type of pathogen from the environment.

547
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:57,287
Once that happens, the immune cells are kind of activated within that injured tissue.

548
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,730
And a bunch of immune cells kind of rush to that

549
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:04,875
site and cause some damage as well as some swelling.

550
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:08,479
So we get this innate acute inflammation.

551
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:14,727
And so when we talk about inflammation, the Latin word

552
00:46:14,727 --> 00:46:18,433
like inflamar is basically to ignite or burn.

553
00:46:18,433 --> 00:46:23,301
And so that's why typically you get that sensation and that's why they call it inflammation.

554
00:46:25,305 --> 00:46:27,789
So let's look at this in a little bit more detail.

555
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:33,960
Again, you have some type of break in that physical barrier.

556
00:46:35,476 --> 00:46:38,400
You introduce some type of pathogen or bacteria, you get

557
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:51,297
the swelling, and all of these cells are trying to come in in response to the external pathogen.

558
00:46:51,297 --> 00:46:57,906
Some cardinal signs of inflammation would be redness, swelling, heat, pain, and loss of function.

559
00:47:04,771 --> 00:47:07,734
OK, so this inflammation that we're talking about usually

560
00:47:07,734 --> 00:47:14,360
is associated with some type of exposure to the external environment where the pathogen comes in.

561
00:47:16,202 --> 00:47:20,086
You also can get something called sterile inflammation.

562
00:47:22,188 --> 00:47:27,833
So sterile inflammation occurs in the absence of a pathogen.

563
00:47:29,615 --> 00:47:31,937
And you might be thinking, oh, well, when does that happen?

564
00:47:31,937 --> 00:47:34,927
Well, I could sprain my ankle here.

565
00:47:34,927 --> 00:47:40,394
or tear a muscle, which can cause some inflammation.

566
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,784
So besides ankle sprains, let's take some time to

567
00:47:48,784 --> 00:47:52,249
chat with your neighbor, besides some ankle sprains, when

568
00:47:52,249 --> 00:47:56,975
else might sterile inflammation occur after exercise?

569
00:47:56,975 --> 00:47:57,936
So after exercise.

570
00:47:59,658 --> 00:48:01,120
Okay, take a few minutes and we'll come back.

571
00:49:44,594 --> 00:49:45,956
Okay, what are we thinking here?

572
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:55,827
Besides like an injury where I sprained my ankle, how

573
00:49:55,827 --> 00:50:00,793
else do you think someone might experience some sterile inflammation after exercise?

574
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:06,379
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll get into that.

575
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:13,487
Again, we'll get into that, but if you tear some of those muscles,

576
00:50:14,395 --> 00:50:17,987
Your body undergoes a lot of these interesting

577
00:50:17,987 --> 00:50:21,398
steps and processes that eventually cause inflammation.

578
00:50:22,802 --> 00:50:23,765
That's a good one.

579
00:50:23,765 --> 00:50:24,949
What's another one?

580
00:50:24,949 --> 00:50:26,835
This one I'd be really surprised if someone got it.

581
00:50:35,438 --> 00:50:38,902
Yeah, yeah, no that's the same kind of concept as

582
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:45,009
the hypertrophy pieces, but this is actually getting really close to what I'm about to mention.

583
00:50:45,009 --> 00:50:48,973
If I cause damage to the muscle fibers because fighters

584
00:50:48,973 --> 00:50:54,159
are kicking things to strengthen up some bone, then yeah, that's gonna cause some inflammation.

585
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:58,364
On that same line, what about runners?

586
00:50:59,245 --> 00:51:01,448
Obviously they're not going around kicking trees while they're

587
00:51:01,448 --> 00:51:05,412
running, but what else kind of happens?

588
00:51:07,417 --> 00:51:11,142
Yeah, so stress fractures, and not necessarily stress factors

589
00:51:11,142 --> 00:51:16,030
in the injury sense, but there's actually something called foot strike hemolysis.

590
00:51:17,231 --> 00:51:22,659
So as I am running, you actually cause a lot of

591
00:51:22,659 --> 00:51:26,725
stress on the muscles and you can actually break some of the red blood cells.

592
00:51:27,526 --> 00:51:30,591
And in response to that, you have a little bit of an inflammation.

593
00:51:31,993 --> 00:51:35,598
So there's some, I guess,

594
00:51:35,598 --> 00:51:40,663
areas where there's not like a full consensus that foot strike hemolysis is causing this.

595
00:51:41,484 --> 00:51:47,870
But I think most people who have run or ran long

596
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:53,896
distance events have experienced this in one form or another.

597
00:51:53,896 --> 00:51:54,537
Here's what I mean.

598
00:51:55,498 --> 00:52:00,443
So this is a volunteered photo here, but we have

599
00:52:00,443 --> 00:52:05,368
a foot that looks perfectly normal here before 100 miles of running.

600
00:52:07,238 --> 00:52:12,605
There was no acute injury, so no ankle sprain or anything like that.

601
00:52:14,347 --> 00:52:19,854
After 100 miles running, that same foot is now swollen.

602
00:52:21,356 --> 00:52:24,840
Now, not everyone has run 100 miles, but believe it or

603
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:32,551
not, even if you ran close to a marathon, your foot swells up

604
00:52:32,551 --> 00:52:35,775
as you are doing this, and it is undergoing some

605
00:52:35,775 --> 00:52:41,642
sort of acute kind of sterile inflammation in that area, a lot

606
00:52:41,642 --> 00:52:48,069
of this is believed due to some of this foot strike hemolysis that's going on.

607
00:52:48,069 --> 00:52:54,416
I think his daughter was like painting his toenails, but that's why that's there.

608
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:54,897
Okay.

609
00:52:57,188 --> 00:52:59,492
So then let me ask you this, we don't need to spend too much time here,

610
00:52:59,492 --> 00:53:02,015
because I think we already have a good idea of this,

611
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:08,786
but so then how can we reduce inflammation after acute exercise or after exercise?

612
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:09,787
Ice is one, yeah.

613
00:53:12,992 --> 00:53:13,353
Elevate.

614
00:53:17,279 --> 00:53:19,863
Oh, so I like where you're going with that, but let's

615
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:24,630
just assume after the exercise you have the inflammation, how can we reduce it?

616
00:53:26,433 --> 00:53:27,614
Compression, good.

617
00:53:28,655 --> 00:53:31,258
I think people are, yeah, someone said it.

618
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:34,242
Rice, yeah, and so what's the E?

619
00:53:36,224 --> 00:53:39,247
Elevation, right, so that's typically what they recommend.

620
00:53:40,348 --> 00:53:43,772
They're saying rest, ice, compress, and elevate.

621
00:53:46,335 --> 00:53:49,318
However, it's interesting with this.

622
00:53:51,357 --> 00:53:57,305
The inflammation process gets a really bad rap because all

623
00:53:57,305 --> 00:53:59,988
the time you're hearing, oh, we gotta take care of this inflammation.

624
00:53:59,988 --> 00:54:02,051
Inflammation is bad, right?

625
00:54:02,051 --> 00:54:04,895
But insufficient evidence is available from randomized control

626
00:54:04,895 --> 00:54:09,361
trials to determine the relative effectiveness of rice therapy

627
00:54:09,361 --> 00:54:12,545
for acute ankle sprains as well as sterile inflammation.

628
00:54:14,428 --> 00:54:16,214
There's two sides to this.

629
00:54:16,214 --> 00:54:17,235
Right?

630
00:54:17,235 --> 00:54:22,383
Inflammation is good in a sense that it's helping deal with some sort of issue.

631
00:54:23,424 --> 00:54:26,469
Clearly it becomes bad if it gets out of control.

632
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:32,938
So I'm on the school of thought that we shouldn't always try to eliminate inflammation.

633
00:54:34,781 --> 00:54:38,726
There was a really good paper published in 2022 that

634
00:54:38,726 --> 00:54:43,453
kind of outlined this idea of acute versus chronic inflammation.

635
00:54:44,632 --> 00:54:48,418
we have some sort of initiation phase where inflammation goes up.

636
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:56,550
In the resolution phase, meaning we're trying to manage this inflammation, it starts to go down.

637
00:54:59,094 --> 00:55:03,421
But every now and then, we don't get it to return.

638
00:55:03,421 --> 00:55:09,610
And so this chronic inflammation is the big problem in my opinion.

639
00:55:11,176 --> 00:55:16,142
Whereas if we don't allow the body to kind of have that natural inflammation

640
00:55:16,142 --> 00:55:24,433
or if I'm always after exercise going in and doing these ice cold baths

641
00:55:24,433 --> 00:55:30,881
or doing these cryotherapies, you might not always be getting

642
00:55:30,881 --> 00:55:38,010
the benefit that you think you are because inflammation in a broad sense is actually pretty good to have.

643
00:55:39,155 --> 00:55:43,722
It's kind of nice that our body responds to this and then we adapt and build back up.

644
00:55:43,722 --> 00:55:46,307
So we need to have some of this stress or this damage.

645
00:55:47,148 --> 00:55:51,114
But this chronic piece is where it becomes a problem.

646
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:52,717
Okay, so chronic inflammation.

647
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:56,804
This is due to persistent infection or prolonged immune response.

648
00:55:56,804 --> 00:56:03,154
Again, low grade inflammation can occur due to inactivity, obesity, and aging.

649
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:09,745
High-grade inflammation with the chronic aspect to it

650
00:56:09,745 --> 00:56:15,169
are usually associated with certain cancers and rheumatoid arthritis.

651
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:22,711
So I know we're always quick to reduce that inflammation.

652
00:56:22,711 --> 00:56:25,295
If I have some sort of injury and I'm having

653
00:56:25,295 --> 00:56:29,181
swelling that's damaging other tissue, yeah, let's get that under control.

654
00:56:29,181 --> 00:56:32,726
But if it's a relatively mild acute inflammation, sometimes

655
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:35,310
it's good to let it undergo its natural process.

656
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:41,539
Okay, number three, the adaptive or acquired immunity.

657
00:56:42,681 --> 00:56:47,248
Acquired is good because we build this over time.

658
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,783
Those cells are the B cells and the T cells.

659
00:56:55,168 --> 00:57:00,675
Because they're adaptive, they recognize and remember certain pathogens.

660
00:57:02,577 --> 00:57:07,864
So if I'm exposed to a certain antigen, this lymphocyte

661
00:57:07,864 --> 00:57:12,350
will then start to produce a bunch of memory cells.

662
00:57:13,632 --> 00:57:18,835
That way, if you're exposed to that same pathogen or antigen in the future,

663
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:25,090
you can respond and try to take care of it in a much faster time frame.

664
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:28,940
I kind of like this piece here, this memory T cell, and we have some E. coli.

665
00:57:30,223 --> 00:57:33,631
And the memory T cell says, I will never forget you.

666
00:57:35,295 --> 00:57:36,706
It's not too bad.

667
00:57:36,706 --> 00:57:40,593
Okay, so if you have some sort of response to

668
00:57:40,593 --> 00:57:45,101
a pathogen and you are mobilizing your adaptive immune system,

669
00:57:45,943 --> 00:57:50,952
typically you get a swelling inside of some of your lymph nodes.

670
00:57:52,417 --> 00:57:57,987
And that usually is a really good indication that you're fighting something off.

671
00:57:57,987 --> 00:58:02,054
So that's why sometimes people would feel their lymph nodes

672
00:58:02,054 --> 00:58:04,439
when they're not feeling great to see if they were

673
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:11,792
swollen, because that might give an indication that you're mobilizing some of those adaptive immune cells.

674
00:58:15,704 --> 00:58:22,913
So there are a lot of these cells, B cells, cytotoxic T cells, helper cells, regulatory T cells.

675
00:58:24,412 --> 00:58:31,081
You don't need to know the details or memorize these, but we are gonna talk about some of these.

676
00:58:31,081 --> 00:58:37,310
So again, when you see maybe a killer T cell or B

677
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:42,157
cell on the improvements due to exercise, or if I'm getting

678
00:58:42,157 --> 00:58:47,044
some type of inhibition, then you know we're looking at the adaptive immune system.

679
00:58:51,817 --> 00:58:53,439
Okay, so let's get into this.

680
00:58:53,439 --> 00:58:55,702
Exercise and the immune system.

681
00:58:59,768 --> 00:59:04,634
Acute, moderate intensity, short duration aerobic exercise

682
00:59:05,916 --> 00:59:11,964
has shown to improve immunosurveillance in the body.

683
00:59:11,964 --> 00:59:15,148
When we're talking about moderate exercise, less than 60 minutes,

684
00:59:15,148 --> 00:59:19,073
we're looking at 40 to 60% of VO2 max.

685
00:59:20,403 --> 00:59:24,147
This helps boost the innate and the adaptive immune

686
00:59:24,147 --> 00:59:27,090
system and those cells associated with those systems.

687
00:59:29,272 --> 00:59:33,256
However, this is kind of transitory, right?

688
00:59:33,256 --> 00:59:36,619
It returns back to normal in about three hours.

689
00:59:39,822 --> 00:59:42,865
There is this idea, though, that you can

690
00:59:42,865 --> 00:59:49,478
potentially enhance your antibody-specific response with vaccinations

691
00:59:49,478 --> 00:59:55,204
with exercise, meaning if I am boosting or improving

692
00:59:55,204 --> 01:00:00,870
the immunosurveillance due to this moderate exercise and I'm due

693
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:05,374
for a vaccine, it's possible that you can improve the

694
01:00:05,374 --> 01:00:08,558
innate or boost the innate and adaptive immune system.

695
01:00:08,558 --> 01:00:10,880
So then when you get the vaccine, you get a more

696
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:17,778
kind of robust response and that your body kind of gets a little bit stronger to that.

697
01:00:17,778 --> 01:00:21,745
antigen or whatever you were exposed to in that vaccine.

698
01:00:21,745 --> 01:00:25,632
Again, it needs a little bit more research, but there's

699
01:00:25,632 --> 01:00:30,300
a lot of suggestions that have kind of indicated that this might be the case.

700
01:00:37,372 --> 01:00:42,621
Okay, acute high-intensity, long-duration aerobic exercise.

701
01:00:43,462 --> 01:00:52,772
prolonged exercise greater than 90 minutes has a temporary depressive effect on the immune system.

702
01:00:54,895 --> 01:01:00,321
That means we are decreasing the levels of the B, T, and the natural killer cells.

703
01:01:01,762 --> 01:01:06,988
We're decreasing the activity as well as the function of the cells that are there.

704
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:14,137
and we're decreasing the sites as well, so in the nasal pathway.

705
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:19,624
We're also increasing the pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

706
01:01:22,407 --> 01:01:28,755
That's interesting, because if I'm decreasing the

707
01:01:28,755 --> 01:01:33,479
immunosurveillance or decreasing our immune system functions,

708
01:01:33,479 --> 01:01:36,244
And that should put that individual at a little

709
01:01:36,244 --> 01:01:40,551
bit more risk, especially in this respiratory tract area.

710
01:01:43,496 --> 01:01:48,684
So then chronic exercise has an impact on infection,

711
01:01:48,684 --> 01:01:53,192
especially if it's kind of this higher intensity, longer duration exercise.

712
01:01:54,387 --> 01:01:58,694
This introduces something called the J-curve model.

713
01:01:58,694 --> 01:02:01,198
This is very similar to a lot of the models we've talked about.

714
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:08,930
But if this over here on the y-axis is the upper respiratory tract infection risk,

715
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:13,217
where above one is a higher risk to get an upper

716
01:02:13,217 --> 01:02:21,050
respiratory tract infection, and below zero is a kind of lower risk to get an infection.

717
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:25,055
Here we have kind of two categories, but they span

718
01:02:25,055 --> 01:02:30,382
along a continuous spectrum where we can go from sedentary all the way to heavy exertion.

719
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:33,606
So this could be exercise workload here.

720
01:02:35,568 --> 01:02:41,115
So if we start on normal where we're sedentary or not exercising, we're here.

721
01:02:41,956 --> 01:02:45,921
We're at our baseline risk.

722
01:02:45,921 --> 01:02:49,926
If I start to exercise, I get a depressive effect

723
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:58,157
Or, sorry, it's not depressing, but you reduce the risk

724
01:02:58,157 --> 01:03:01,683
that you're gonna get a upper respiratory tract infection.

725
01:03:02,824 --> 01:03:03,385
That's a good thing.

726
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:10,176
As I increase in the exercise intensity, I start to

727
01:03:10,176 --> 01:03:16,065
increase the risk that I'm going to experience an upper respiratory tract infection.

728
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,042
And you might have seen this.

729
01:03:20,042 --> 01:03:22,866
If you have friends or you are a kind

730
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:29,837
of competitive endurance athlete, sometimes those individuals are constantly fighting something.

731
01:03:29,837 --> 01:03:33,182
They might be fighting a cold or things like that, and that's not always the case,

732
01:03:34,024 --> 01:03:36,728
but they are putting themselves at a little bit of

733
01:03:36,728 --> 01:03:40,649
a higher risk for getting an upper respiratory tract infection.

734
01:03:40,649 --> 01:03:44,055
We'll talk about some of the other factors as to

735
01:03:44,055 --> 01:03:50,486
what's contributing to that, but in general, this J-curve model is explaining some of it.

736
01:03:52,049 --> 01:03:53,912
So what you can take away from this is if

737
01:03:53,912 --> 01:04:03,349
I'm engaging in this constant moderate exercise over long periods of time, I can help reduce

738
01:04:04,645 --> 01:04:07,348
the risk of getting an upper respiratory tract infection.

739
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:11,574
If I'm always kind of going 100% all the

740
01:04:11,574 --> 01:04:16,560
time, maximum exercise intensity, you actually are putting yourself at

741
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:19,965
a little bit of a higher risk for getting an infection.

742
01:04:27,534 --> 01:04:31,159
No, that's, so the data are mostly

743
01:04:32,236 --> 01:04:35,760
on this upper respiratory tract infection, but they go all the way throughout.

744
01:04:38,262 --> 01:04:43,068
Yeah, yeah, yeah, because you're just putting your body at a really high stress point,

745
01:04:43,068 --> 01:04:49,274
and so now the body's fighting, fighting, it's recovering from all that stress you just put on it,

746
01:04:49,274 --> 01:04:51,797
and it has less energy or time to maybe fight off

747
01:04:51,797 --> 01:04:58,564
pathogens, as opposed to this piece here, like increasing that immunosurveillance.

748
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:07,945
How are we doing?

749
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:10,052
Not too bad.

750
01:05:11,757 --> 01:05:14,627
I feel like if I keep going, we're going to have nothing for Tuesday.

751
01:05:14,627 --> 01:05:18,098
So have a great weekend.

752
01:05:18,098 --> 01:05:20,265
I'll see you on Tuesday.

753
01:05:32,969 --> 01:05:54,083
So just a quick recap on like the...
