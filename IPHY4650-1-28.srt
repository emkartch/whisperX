1
00:02:25,285 --> 00:02:25,845
All right.

2
00:02:25,865 --> 00:02:29,546
Welcome back, everyone.

3
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,308
So hopefully you had a good weekend.

4
00:02:36,328 --> 00:02:39,008
It's a decent amount of snow.

5
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:41,509
So that was kind of nice, right, if you like the snow.

6
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:44,550
But today,

7
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:49,898
We're gonna pick up on bioenergetics and exercise metabolism.

8
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:55,102
We're gonna make a pretty good dent in the rest of these slides.

9
00:02:55,122 --> 00:02:59,065
We'll finish them up on Thursday and start chapter five on Thursday as well.

10
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:05,069
So, hopefully lab two was good for the Monday section.

11
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:11,494
I know today and tomorrow we have the other sections, but that'll be a fun one to start using some of the Douglas bags.

12
00:03:13,636 --> 00:03:15,217
Which should,

13
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:24,778
These topics are going to give you a little bit of a good background or review for what you did in lab.

14
00:03:26,263 --> 00:03:33,532
But so far, to this point, we talked about kind of that immediate energy source, so the ATP, phosphocreatine.

15
00:03:34,252 --> 00:03:38,477
And then we talked about how it can generate a lot of energy very quickly.

16
00:03:38,557 --> 00:03:41,981
We just don't have a lot of stores available to kind of pull on that.

17
00:03:42,442 --> 00:03:46,006
Then we moved to the rapid non-oxidative glycolysis.

18
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:48,488
So that piece is the same deal.

19
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:56,255
So we can generate ATP a little bit more faster than oxidative, but not as fast as the ATP PC system.

20
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,598
But again, not very efficient.

21
00:04:00,678 --> 00:04:03,300
Doesn't generate a whole lot of ATP.

22
00:04:04,842 --> 00:04:06,923
That moves us into this third piece here.

23
00:04:07,244 --> 00:04:10,126
So this is the oxidative phosphorylation.

24
00:04:10,806 --> 00:04:14,590
And when we talk about oxidative phosphorylation, that means oxygen

25
00:04:16,053 --> 00:04:19,797
is involved in the phosphorylation of ADP.

26
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,024
So it has to be there in order for this reaction to occur.

27
00:04:26,044 --> 00:04:28,968
OK.

28
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:36,923
So here we're kind of looking in this section of the figure.

29
00:04:37,864 --> 00:04:47,337
But keep in mind, we do or this process does rely a lot on the generation of pyruvate, especially if we're trying to break down carbohydrate.

30
00:04:48,018 --> 00:04:55,121
So this is where a little bit of confusion comes into play where it's, okay, well, is glycolysis oxidative or non-oxidative?

31
00:04:55,541 --> 00:05:03,005
Well, it's kind of both, and so we kind of term it either the non-oxidative glycolysis or we just kind of deem everything else oxidative.

32
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:16,691
So when we're in the oxidative phosphorylation and then the Krebs cycle, we are looking at a much larger yield for ATP in this process.

33
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:26,898
So it is aerobic, or in this instance, we actually do require oxygen in order to form that ATP.

34
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:30,923
Depending on the substrate, we get 32 ATP or 33 on the glycogen, and then

35
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,982
100 plus for ATP for free fatty acid.

36
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:41,943
I feel like we did touch on some of these slides.

37
00:05:42,164 --> 00:05:46,246
So I'm going to fly, not fly, but I'm going to go through these a little bit faster.

38
00:05:46,986 --> 00:05:50,869
So steady state supply, we can get that for hours.

39
00:05:51,689 --> 00:06:00,575
It is the most complex because, again, we need to rely, if we're talking about carbohydrates, we need to rely on the pyruvate, then the Krebs cycle, and then they need to go to the ETC.

40
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:05,578
So there are many more steps in oxidative phosphorylation.

41
00:06:07,622 --> 00:06:14,866
So the oxidation of carbs, we're really looking at, we first need this glycolysis piece here.

42
00:06:16,807 --> 00:06:18,268
And really, same deal.

43
00:06:18,488 --> 00:06:23,851
We don't really have to worry about all the enzymes involved in glycolysis.

44
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:30,675
PFK is probably the only one you should try to keep in the back of your mind, because that's the rate-limiting enzyme.

45
00:06:31,395 --> 00:06:34,597
But essentially, we are taking two NADs

46
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:37,423
forming two NADHs.

47
00:06:37,903 --> 00:06:39,884
And in that process, we get two pyruvate.

48
00:06:41,744 --> 00:06:43,825
Now, this is another good reminder here.

49
00:06:44,225 --> 00:06:55,230
If we are short on the NADs, if we don't have any of these NAD pluses available, there is no way we can have this intermediary step occur.

50
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:02,573
Because of that, if there is a step to free up these

51
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:06,760
So remove the hydrogens and free up these NAD pluses.

52
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,262
Well, the body's going to undertake that step as quickly as possible.

53
00:07:10,302 --> 00:07:12,783
And we can do that by converting pyruvate to lactate.

54
00:07:14,964 --> 00:07:16,265
So it'll free up these NADs.

55
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:20,407
But we are in the oxidative piece.

56
00:07:21,428 --> 00:07:26,951
So we can get rid of the pyruvates because we're not going to have too large of a buildup of the pyruvates.

57
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:31,454
And we can send these two pyruvates into the mitochondria.

58
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,401
One carbon kind of splits off.

59
00:07:34,781 --> 00:07:38,362
We get the two, or we get acetyl-CoA, which is a two-carbon atom.

60
00:07:38,822 --> 00:07:39,762
You get two of those.

61
00:07:41,383 --> 00:07:43,083
And then it runs through this Krebs cycle here.

62
00:07:46,084 --> 00:07:49,065
After the Krebs cycle, then it goes to electron transport chain.

63
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:52,786
And that's where the majority of the ATP is being produced.

64
00:07:55,947 --> 00:07:59,148
Should be mostly review from physiology here.

65
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:03,019
OK, so we'll start with glycolysis.

66
00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:06,360
Glycolysis can occur with or without oxygen.

67
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:12,783
And this is more of like the environment or maybe the downstream effects.

68
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:27,009
Can we send the pyruvate to the mitochondria and ultimately get those NADHs and FADHs out and then at the ETC utilize oxygen to create ATP?

69
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:29,610
That's what it's talking about with or without O2.

70
00:08:32,497 --> 00:08:37,360
OK, ATP yield is the same as the anaerobic or non-oxidative glycolysis.

71
00:08:39,282 --> 00:08:43,464
And again, we get pyruvate moves into the mitochondria.

72
00:08:43,805 --> 00:08:45,726
One of those carbons gets stripped off.

73
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:52,731
We are basically removing it, and we're getting a CO2, a carbon dioxide, in the process.

74
00:08:57,978 --> 00:09:01,059
So big picture, we get two pyruvate from glycolysis.

75
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:04,080
They enter in the mitochondria as acetyl-CoA.

76
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:19,066
Then they enter the Krebs cycle or the citric acid cycle inside the mitochondria in order for us to generate some of these NADs and FADs, or NADHs and FADHs.

77
00:09:19,946 --> 00:09:24,048
So one mole of glucose gets me two acetyl-CoA.

78
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:34,532
Therefore, one molecule or molecule glucose gets two complete Krebs cycles or two complete turns.

79
00:09:40,353 --> 00:09:42,934
And you get double the ATP yield.

80
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:56,316
In this process, when you're converting the two acetyl-CoA, you are able to get two ATPs.

81
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:04,741
You also produce, like I mentioned before, NADHs, FADHs, and some hydrogens.

82
00:10:08,143 --> 00:10:12,305
If you get too many hydrogens in the cell, that becomes a little too acidic.

83
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:16,107
So we're trying to shuttle some of these hydrogens away.

84
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:20,108
They do sometimes spill over outside of the mitochondria into the blood.

85
00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:27,012
But in reality, a lot of these hydrogens are staying inside of the mitochondria to help us

86
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:35,190
kind of produce the ATP with the ATP synthase.

87
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:40,576
So these hydrogens here carry to the electron transport chain.

88
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:46,123
And we're doing that mainly in the form of the NADHs, FADHs.

89
00:10:52,577 --> 00:10:57,681
So the electrons are basically powering the cytochromes inside of the mitochondria.

90
00:10:57,701 --> 00:10:59,343
I'll show you a figure on the next slide.

91
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:07,009
Those are powering basically these pumps, these proton pumps, to establish this hydrogen gradient.

92
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:12,693
That way, the hydrogens can move down through the ATP synthase and help generate ATP.

93
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:19,419
Then as the hydrogens come down, it's going to combine with oxygen to form water.

94
00:11:21,618 --> 00:11:25,301
And in the process, every NADH, we get 2.5 ATP.

95
00:11:25,641 --> 00:11:30,945
And every FADH2, you get 1.5 ATP.

96
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:41,934
So here's a figure pretty much describing what is going on with the bullet points we just talked about.

97
00:11:43,323 --> 00:11:45,666
So this is happening inside the mitochondria.

98
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:49,870
So we have the outer mitochondrial compartment and then the matrix.

99
00:11:50,631 --> 00:12:01,362
Essentially, the NADHs are dropping off the electron in order to power the cytochromes, which then pump the hydrogens into the outer mitochondrial space.

100
00:12:01,983 --> 00:12:04,364
You're establishing that hydrogen gradient.

101
00:12:04,904 --> 00:12:09,565
So you have a high concentration of hydrogen molecules and a low concentration of hydrogen molecules.

102
00:12:09,925 --> 00:12:11,966
They want to go down that gradient.

103
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:19,428
So they come over here to this little, basically this protein that is forming ATP.

104
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,329
This protein is called ATP synthase.

105
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:26,695
It's kind of fascinating, this ATP synthase.

106
00:12:27,736 --> 00:12:30,319
You can imagine maybe like an amusement park.

107
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:31,640
You get those little turnstiles.

108
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,923
You walk through the turnstile, and it just kind of moves it through.

109
00:12:36,164 --> 00:12:40,527
The hydrogens are basically going through this protein.

110
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:48,294
They're essentially kind of turning this turbine that helps combine the ADP and the ATP.

111
00:12:49,676 --> 00:12:51,217
And so that's kind of what's going on over here.

112
00:12:52,757 --> 00:12:54,297
And then we're getting our ATP.

113
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,100
OK, summary then.

114
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:07,321
For one glucose, we're getting 32 ATP.

115
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:09,782
One glycogen, we get 33 ATP.

116
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:20,045
If we're trying to get the net totals here, glycolysis, we get either two or three ATP, depending on if it's coming from glucose or glycogen.

117
00:13:22,657 --> 00:13:28,098
We get 2 ATP from the Krebs cycle by converting GTP into ATP.

118
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:34,679
And since the Krebs cycle spins twice, that's where we get the 2 ATP.

119
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:38,620
You get 10 NADHs.

120
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,141
That's going to be 25 ATP, because they're 2.5 apiece.

121
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:47,481
And then you have two FADHs.

122
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:48,601
Each one's 1.5.

123
00:13:49,342 --> 00:13:51,322
That gives you the total of three.

124
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,433
Then you can add them all up, and that's where you get your 32 or 33.

125
00:13:56,773 --> 00:14:08,982
Here's another figure depicting the exact same thing we just talked about, showing where the ATP are being generated from each step.

126
00:14:13,966 --> 00:14:14,647
Questions on this?

127
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,070
All right.

128
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:20,772
Not too bad, then.

129
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,722
Okay, so let's talk about beta oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation.

130
00:14:27,762 --> 00:14:28,802
So that was carbohydrate.

131
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:35,884
For breaking down glycogen or glucose, we need to go through glycolysis, pyruvate, Krebs cycle, ETC.

132
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:46,648
Beta oxidation is a little bit different because we don't undergo glycolysis with beta oxidation or oxidation of your lipids.

133
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,270
So the oxidation of fat or lipolysis

134
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:59,814
is kind of the starting, I guess, procedure of this whole oxidative phosphorylation with fats.

135
00:15:01,054 --> 00:15:05,496
So since triglycerides are the major fat energy source, we're going to focus on that.

136
00:15:06,616 --> 00:15:12,678
You are going to take your triglyceride, and you're going to break it down into one glycerol and three free fatty acids.

137
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:15,479
This is pretty key here.

138
00:15:17,536 --> 00:15:33,928
Once you free up these free fatty acids from the triglycerides and the glycerol backbone, the rate of the free fatty acid as far as how it enters into the muscle is dependent on the concentration gradient.

139
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,852
So to get glucose into the cell, does anyone remember?

140
00:15:38,912 --> 00:15:41,374
Maybe you've taken endo or you remember from physiology.

141
00:15:41,394 --> 00:15:42,935
How do we get glucose into the cell?

142
00:15:46,098 --> 00:15:46,578
Any ideas?

143
00:15:49,212 --> 00:15:49,492
Say again?

144
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:55,799
Yeah, so you definitely do that once it's in the cell.

145
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:03,367
But if I have just glucose moving around inside the blood, how do I actually bring glucose into the cell?

146
00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:17,520
Yeah, yeah, typically we rely on hormones like insulin to then upregulate Glut4 transporters.

147
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,723
They translocate to the membrane, and then you bring the glucose into the cell.

148
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:26,529
Free fatty acids, though, anyone want to take a guess how they get into the cell?

149
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,194
Now you have to go way back, not way back, but like biology, physiology.

150
00:16:31,414 --> 00:16:33,256
What's the composition of cell membranes?

151
00:16:38,618 --> 00:16:42,421
Yeah, they just go through the cell membrane because you have that phospholipid bilayer.

152
00:16:43,261 --> 00:16:44,882
They just naturally diffuse in.

153
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:51,807
Granted, they need a carrier protein in the blood to get around because they can't really travel on their own in the blood.

154
00:16:51,847 --> 00:16:54,328
But once they get to the cell membrane, they could freely cross.

155
00:16:55,489 --> 00:16:59,672
So they are dependent on that concentration gradient.

156
00:17:02,274 --> 00:17:08,736
The hard part is you've got to free up the free fatty acids from the triglycerides, transport them all the way to the muscle.

157
00:17:09,077 --> 00:17:10,997
And then they get to diffuse into the muscle.

158
00:17:11,037 --> 00:17:13,238
Then we can kind of work with them in there.

159
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:17,059
OK, nice thing about that.

160
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,300
It's a little bit slower, right?

161
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,141
We've got to transport them over, got to break them down.

162
00:17:21,861 --> 00:17:26,463
But they yield three to four times more ATP than glucose.

163
00:17:29,156 --> 00:17:33,640
So this is much slower than glucose oxidation for all the steps that I just mentioned before.

164
00:17:36,302 --> 00:17:37,683
Don't worry too much.

165
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:39,344
You would never have to memorize this here.

166
00:17:39,404 --> 00:17:42,407
But essentially what this is saying is you have a triglyceride.

167
00:17:42,987 --> 00:17:51,955
We are relying on hormone-sensitive lipase in order to break down the triglyceride into glycerol and free fatty acids.

168
00:17:52,835 --> 00:17:58,220
It would be these free fatty acids that we are relying on oxidative phosphorylation.

169
00:18:02,383 --> 00:18:07,565
Okay, so now that we have a free fatty acid, we're ready to go.

170
00:18:08,746 --> 00:18:11,987
We need to figure out how to get this into the Krebs cycle.

171
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:24,413
So you have a really long chain, but the Krebs cycle only really, well, it prefers really to accept these two carbon molecules called acetyl-CoA.

172
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:27,730
OK, well that's kind of convenient then.

173
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,590
We got this long free fatty acid.

174
00:18:30,131 --> 00:18:31,011
It's an even number.

175
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:33,912
Let's just chop it into two carbon acetyl CoAs.

176
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,753
And so that is beta oxidation.

177
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:43,696
So that's the process of converting your free fatty acids into acetyl CoAs before they go into the Krebs cycle.

178
00:18:48,137 --> 00:18:48,837
Nothing's free.

179
00:18:49,818 --> 00:18:55,260
So in order to start this process, it requires two ATP up front.

180
00:18:57,105 --> 00:18:58,645
So you have your free fatty acid.

181
00:18:58,665 --> 00:19:09,668
In order to start cleaving off those two carbon acetyl CoAs, you need to put in two ATP to start that process.

182
00:19:13,588 --> 00:19:15,729
OK, so how many acetyl CoAs do you get?

183
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:22,510
Well, that depends on the number of carbons that free fatty acid is composed of.

184
00:19:23,611 --> 00:19:25,511
So if we have palmitic acid over here,

185
00:19:26,943 --> 00:19:29,585
It is a 16-carbon free fatty acid.

186
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:33,608
That would mean it yields eight acetyl-CoAs.

187
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:40,553
If I put eight acetyl-CoAs, or eight turns of the Krebs cycle, that's going to give me 106 ATP.

188
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:49,159
And then one glucose yields two acetyl-CoAs, 32-33 ATP.

189
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:50,400
Well, 32 with the glucose, but glycogen 33.

190
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:07,334
So fat oxidation requires more oxygen now or at that point in time, but yields more ATP.

191
00:20:14,258 --> 00:20:15,059
Any questions here?

192
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:17,580
Yeah.

193
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:32,339
Yeah, so if you think about how many each turn inside of the Krebs cycle is going to yield the NADHs and the FADHs, and then you just multiply that.

194
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,060
So each NADH is 2.5 ATP.

195
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,401
Each FADH is 1.5.

196
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:41,664
But then you have to subtract off the 2 ATP to start the beta oxidation.

197
00:20:42,044 --> 00:20:42,565
We'll go through.

198
00:20:42,585 --> 00:20:45,626
There's actually a nice little formula on the next slide that'll help.

199
00:20:46,907 --> 00:20:48,448
Or not next slide, but in a couple slides.

200
00:20:51,403 --> 00:20:53,744
So this is kind of showing the same concept here.

201
00:20:54,364 --> 00:20:55,745
We have your free fatty acid.

202
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:58,286
We get it inside of the mitochondria.

203
00:20:58,326 --> 00:20:59,947
We undergo beta oxidation.

204
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:05,250
So each kind of one of these turn is going to free up some acetyl CoA's.

205
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:11,172
From there, you treat it the same way you would treat it as glucose oxidation.

206
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:15,575
It doesn't matter where the acetyl CoA came from.

207
00:21:15,595 --> 00:21:18,456
It's going to enter in the Krebs cycle and behave the exact same way.

208
00:21:21,474 --> 00:21:26,997
So the net yield here would be 14 ATP per beta oxidation cycle.

209
00:21:28,197 --> 00:21:31,959
So each acetyl CoA is going to yield 10 ATP.

210
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,721
One NADH is going to be 2.5.

211
00:21:37,782 --> 00:21:40,843
And then one FADH is 1.5, just like I mentioned before.

212
00:21:45,858 --> 00:21:58,201
Don't worry too much about, man, I have to keep track of how many cycles, how many spins, and how many times it goes in the CREB, and then how many GTP or GDP, ATP, NADH, FADH.

213
00:21:58,962 --> 00:21:59,402
Don't worry.

214
00:22:00,082 --> 00:22:01,382
We have this little formula here.

215
00:22:02,263 --> 00:22:05,744
So the total ATP here is n minus 1 times 14 plus 10 minus 2.

216
00:22:10,973 --> 00:22:13,595
N is the number of acetyl CoAs that you're getting.

217
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:19,180
You can calculate that by the number of carbons in your free fatty acid chain divided by two.

218
00:22:23,444 --> 00:22:32,432
Then you subtract off, so you do N minus one, so the number of rounds of beta oxidation.

219
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:35,255
Then you minus off this two.

220
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:42,074
because of the upfront ATP expenditure that it costs to start the beta oxidation.

221
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:54,124
OK, it's nice seeing this formula here, but it's even more fun to try it out.

222
00:22:55,405 --> 00:23:01,310
All right, let's calculate the ATP yield from this 26-carbon free fatty acid.

223
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,411
The formula is down below.

224
00:23:04,432 --> 00:23:05,113
Let's try it out.

225
00:24:00,265 --> 00:24:05,707
And then once you're done, we could try this out here.

226
00:25:40,697 --> 00:25:42,999
OK, are we doing OK with this one?

227
00:25:46,021 --> 00:25:51,886
Let's try submitting your answer here in the next 20 seconds, unless someone needs more time than that.

228
00:25:54,588 --> 00:25:56,869
All right, 20 seconds here, or now 15.

229
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:16,250
Okay, I'll close this down in five seconds unless someone needs more time.

230
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:20,797
Okay, three, two, one.

231
00:26:23,642 --> 00:26:24,964
All right, we did really well here.

232
00:26:30,678 --> 00:26:34,480
OK, so when you go through this, you have n minus 1.

233
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,183
If we have a 26-carbon chain here, you need to divide that by 2.

234
00:26:41,103 --> 00:26:42,124
So we have 13.

235
00:26:42,164 --> 00:26:44,525
13 minus 1 is 12.

236
00:26:45,325 --> 00:26:45,646
12 times 14.

237
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:48,947
Then you add on basically 8.

238
00:26:49,448 --> 00:26:50,788
You add on 10, subtract 2.

239
00:26:50,828 --> 00:26:53,530
It should get you very close to, well, not very close.

240
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:53,770
It is 176.

241
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:57,972
That would be the correct answer here.

242
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:03,515
Any questions on this one?

243
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:07,719
OK.

244
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:15,126
So here's what I like to do every now and then here in the semester.

245
00:27:16,362 --> 00:27:20,684
I think these clicker questions are obviously relatively straightforward.

246
00:27:21,005 --> 00:27:26,448
So they're easy, but they're a good way to get an idea of maybe to get some practice.

247
00:27:27,388 --> 00:27:32,491
I value them, and I value them so much that I'm going to make a little wager with you here.

248
00:27:33,972 --> 00:27:36,053
So if we can get 100%

249
00:27:40,323 --> 00:27:42,485
on these questions, on a clicker question.

250
00:27:43,366 --> 00:27:50,393
I will, word for word, put that clicker question on your exam.

251
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:59,642
Sounds pretty nice now, but I'm telling you, it doesn't happen, I think it's only happened once or twice, but you're gonna change the trend here, right?

252
00:28:00,663 --> 00:28:00,783
So.

253
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:07,473
Again, there are a few rules that I kinda wanna have.

254
00:28:07,613 --> 00:28:09,674
One is everybody needs to click in.

255
00:28:09,714 --> 00:28:13,835
You can't just nominate one person to click in and say, okay, we're doing that.

256
00:28:14,415 --> 00:28:22,016
And then no yelling out the answer or trying to sway the room by saying, everyone click in A or something like that.

257
00:28:22,337 --> 00:28:23,597
Does that sound fair?

258
00:28:24,817 --> 00:28:28,778
Okay, so now it's like, oh, now you're gonna pay attention to these clickers, huh?

259
00:28:29,658 --> 00:28:32,399
Okay, so we have a few more today.

260
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:41,784
It'll pretty much go all the way throughout the, I mean, I'll probably cap them at some, at a point.

261
00:28:41,964 --> 00:28:45,906
I don't think it'll ever happen, but if you happen to get like, I don't know, five of them, I'd be like, okay.

262
00:28:46,366 --> 00:28:48,347
Probably need to stop it, but okay.

263
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:50,468
But I've never seen that.

264
00:28:50,508 --> 00:28:54,170
It's not gonna, I have faith, but it's probably not gonna happen, so.

265
00:28:55,551 --> 00:28:55,751
Okay.

266
00:28:57,963 --> 00:29:01,264
Here's a little chart here that you can fill in on your own time.

267
00:29:01,344 --> 00:29:08,285
I think this would be a really great way to try to review the different pathways that we just talked about.

268
00:29:08,365 --> 00:29:12,526
So the ATP-APC system, glycolysis, and oxidative phosphorylation.

269
00:29:13,706 --> 00:29:18,667
I know this one gets a little tricky here with glycolysis and oxygen requirement.

270
00:29:18,727 --> 00:29:25,268
We're basically gonna pretend or we're gonna label that glycolysis the non-oxidative glycolysis piece.

271
00:29:26,462 --> 00:29:29,405
So in that instance, it would be anaerobic.

272
00:29:30,025 --> 00:29:39,855
If you put down both, I'd be OK with that as well, because technically, glycolysis is part of the oxidative phosphorylation.

273
00:29:45,267 --> 00:29:48,710
Okay, again, try to take some time, fill those out on your own.

274
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:59,881
I'm more than happy to meet with you either in help hours or any other time, and I can take a quick look at it, make sure you're on the same, you're on the right track.

275
00:30:04,495 --> 00:30:12,384
This is another really good figure depicting the same concept that we've been talking about as far as capacity and energy generation.

276
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:17,170
So here we have maximal rate of ATP generation.

277
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:22,917
So how much energy or ATP can be produced by these systems?

278
00:30:24,251 --> 00:30:34,299
No surprise, phosphocreatine, the PCR system, is gonna be able to generate the most amount of ATP per second.

279
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:41,946
So the rate of ATP generation is the highest with the ATP PC system.

280
00:30:43,787 --> 00:30:52,755
No surprise since it's just stripping off a phosphate from the phosphocreatine, putting it on the ADP, you get ATP done, right, very fast.

281
00:30:53,891 --> 00:30:57,474
Next, glycolysis, then carbohydrate oxidation, and then fat oxidation.

282
00:30:59,176 --> 00:31:00,778
Maximal energy available.

283
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:12,789
Well, this is the number of ATPs or the mole of ATPs that could be generated if we liberated all of the ATP from those stores.

284
00:31:14,191 --> 00:31:16,413
PCR and glycolysis, very low.

285
00:31:18,697 --> 00:31:22,361
Carbohydrate oxidation, pretty high, not too bad.

286
00:31:22,942 --> 00:31:29,970
And then fat oxidation, we're basically not limited in the amount of triglycerides that we have in our body.

287
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:32,073
We cannot deplete them all.

288
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,596
And if we do, we would not be alive.

289
00:31:35,657 --> 00:31:37,259
So we are not limited here.

290
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:51,523
OK, any questions so far until we move on to the next topic here, which is fuel utilization?

291
00:31:51,903 --> 00:31:52,123
Oh, yeah.

292
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,121
Yeah, yeah, can you hang tight on the next group of slides?

293
00:32:04,161 --> 00:32:05,001
Yeah, that's a great question.

294
00:32:05,021 --> 00:32:13,624
The question was basically, can we determine when we're actually using fats more than carbohydrates, what type of exercises, what type of intensity, maybe duration?

295
00:32:14,464 --> 00:32:19,426
That is this whole fuel utilization during exercise.

296
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:27,328
What are we primarily using during certain activities or exercises?

297
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:37,699
The Monday lab, you've seen the Douglas bag technique, but I like to show this because it wasn't too long ago.

298
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,422
Obviously, this was a while ago.

299
00:32:40,823 --> 00:32:47,853
But the individuals, if they wanted to know their substrate utilization for an athlete,

300
00:32:49,187 --> 00:32:50,808
They would have to run on a track.

301
00:32:51,248 --> 00:32:54,929
And it's kind of tough to see here, but these are Douglas bags that they're carrying.

302
00:32:54,969 --> 00:32:57,730
So the Monday class, you've seen what those Douglas bags look like.

303
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:04,113
Tuesday and Wednesday, you'll see how you can fill those up during rest and exercise.

304
00:33:04,573 --> 00:33:06,153
But essentially, they're driving a car.

305
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:10,375
And they have this two-way breathing valve hooked up to this runner.

306
00:33:10,995 --> 00:33:17,358
And then on the hood, you have these researchers basically filling up these bags of expired air.

307
00:33:18,341 --> 00:33:20,363
And then they can go analyze them a little bit later.

308
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:30,531
So you're basically going to go through with these calculations and collection techniques for the first, well, I guess, lab two and three.

309
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:37,276
And then after that, thank goodness for the invention of computerized technology.

310
00:33:38,337 --> 00:33:40,939
So now we use something called the Parvo.

311
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:44,522
And it basically does all of those calculations automatically.

312
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:54,387
So the Haldane equations that you're going through in lab this week, they're going to seem pretty tedious, and they're going to take a very long time, whereas the computer does it in seconds.

313
00:33:57,149 --> 00:33:58,490
You'll get to experience both.

314
00:33:59,511 --> 00:34:06,356
But essentially, we're trying to figure out how much oxygen you're consuming per minute versus the carbon dioxide produced per minute.

315
00:34:07,657 --> 00:34:08,958
The nice thing about this

316
00:34:10,575 --> 00:34:17,700
If we go back to how we're oxidating carbohydrates and fats, it's just a matter of breaking down the carbons.

317
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:21,743
In that process, you are releasing carbon dioxide.

318
00:34:22,684 --> 00:34:28,809
Well, that's pretty nice because I know how many carbons are in a glucose molecule or a fat or a lipid chain.

319
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:34,073
And then if you show me how many carbons got released, I know how many you broke down.

320
00:34:35,595 --> 00:34:44,844
So what we can do then is estimate your fuel utilization during exercise by using something called the respiratory exchange ratio or RER.

321
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:51,771
Sometimes in textbooks, you'll see it as R or RQ.

322
00:34:53,112 --> 00:34:55,615
In this course, we're basically saying they're interchangeable.

323
00:34:56,908 --> 00:35:02,030
The reason why they are a little different, RER is the respiratory exchange ratio.

324
00:35:03,071 --> 00:35:05,212
RQ is like the respiratory quotient.

325
00:35:05,692 --> 00:35:14,336
And that's if I put something like a mitochondria in a Petri dish and it started infusing oxygen in there, then I can get a really good idea of these calculations here.

326
00:35:15,176 --> 00:35:19,118
So R and RQ, that's happening at the cell or at the muscle.

327
00:35:20,098 --> 00:35:27,101
RER, respiratory exchange ratio, that's happening on when I'm actually expiring out because we're collecting the expired gas.

328
00:35:28,021 --> 00:35:32,763
And you'll see why that kind of matters when we talk about maybe the limits of RER.

329
00:35:34,403 --> 00:35:34,643
OK.

330
00:35:35,123 --> 00:35:47,608
In order to calculate this, we need VCO2 over VO2 to rely on this calculation for energy expenditure and substrate utilization.

331
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:55,724
The individuals must be at steady state and the exercise has to be submaximal.

332
00:35:57,365 --> 00:36:01,827
We typically deem submaximal a workload that's below lactate threshold.

333
00:36:04,848 --> 00:36:14,833
If we satisfy these requirements, then we know the oxygen that is used during that exercise task is going to represent metabolism quite well.

334
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,842
and we can start doing some substrate utilization calculations.

335
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:29,007
If we have more carbons in a molecule, no surprise that we'll need more oxygens to break them down.

336
00:36:31,548 --> 00:36:38,772
We do not assume or we do not consider protein as a fuel source during exercise.

337
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:45,155
And you might think, well, what about those extreme circumstances or just those unique cases

338
00:36:46,407 --> 00:36:54,469
Well, the researchers actually did this and they tried, well not tried, they actually accounted for the protein breakdown.

339
00:36:55,189 --> 00:36:59,530
And it's so small that it doesn't even impact these calculations.

340
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:14,493
To reduce the complications of trying to account for nitrogen being excreted outside of the body and sweat or urine, it's just not worth trying to get those types of calculations in there.

341
00:37:15,955 --> 00:37:30,123
So when you're doing the RER calculations, it's just based off of carbohydrates and fats, mainly because we are no longer trying to measure nitrogen coming out of other areas.

342
00:37:31,564 --> 00:37:36,246
And the protein sources don't even make a huge contribution to energy expenditure.

343
00:37:39,528 --> 00:37:44,351
OK, so let's see what we can get from this RER formula here.

344
00:37:45,687 --> 00:37:52,432
If we are looking at R or RER for fat, as an example, we'll stay with palmitic acid.

345
00:37:53,913 --> 00:37:58,777
We have C16H32 and two oxygens.

346
00:37:59,697 --> 00:38:03,901
We combust that with 23 oxygen molecules, O2 molecules.

347
00:38:04,901 --> 00:38:08,324
We then have 16 CO2s and 16 hydrogens.

348
00:38:11,086 --> 00:38:11,927
I can just take.

349
00:38:13,936 --> 00:38:20,581
16 CO2s, put them here, divide it by the amount of oxygen it took to fully combust the palmitic acid.

350
00:38:21,161 --> 00:38:22,322
I then get a ratio of 0.7.

351
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:31,890
So if I'm only burning fats, this ratio will stand.

352
00:38:33,351 --> 00:38:39,455
And so that's why this says R, because in a petri dish or some bomb kilometer,

353
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:51,338
I can control the parameters of the environment and see how many carbon dioxides get released for however many oxygen molecules it took to combust that molecule.

354
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,260
And that's the ratio here.

355
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,021
16 divided by 23, you get 0.7.

356
00:38:59,743 --> 00:39:02,685
If we are looking at glucose, a glucose molecule, C6H12O6,

357
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:11,239
It takes six oxygen molecules to fully combust your glucose.

358
00:39:12,379 --> 00:39:14,520
You release six carbon dioxides.

359
00:39:16,081 --> 00:39:17,441
And you also release some water.

360
00:39:19,462 --> 00:39:26,045
Well, I can take the 6 CO2 divided by the 6 O2, and we get a 1 to 1 ratio.

361
00:39:28,005 --> 00:39:33,768
If I am only burning carbohydrates, I would have an RER or an R of 1.

362
00:39:38,596 --> 00:39:40,017
Are we OK here so far?

363
00:39:41,138 --> 00:39:41,338
Nice.

364
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:54,167
So the nice thing about this, if we have the caps, we have 0.7 and 1, well, then it's very easy to fill everything out in between.

365
00:39:55,728 --> 00:40:04,675
If an individual is burning 100% fat, that's 0.7, we have something called the caloric equivalent for oxygen.

366
00:40:06,722 --> 00:40:12,924
We know how much energy it's going to release by burning 100% fat.

367
00:40:14,864 --> 00:40:19,145
So we have 100% fat, and then we can move all the way down to 100% carbohydrate.

368
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:25,667
An R, or an RER of about 0.85, usually not for everyone, but is pretty close to 50-50.

369
00:40:30,419 --> 00:40:37,283
We'll talk about what intensities or how we can actually move along the spectrum with different exercises.

370
00:40:38,804 --> 00:40:44,887
But for now, I want to kind of key into this column over here.

371
00:40:48,249 --> 00:40:49,030
That's a little weird.

372
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,952
If I am burning 100% fat, I'm releasing 4.69 kcals.

373
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:06,315
What have you learned earlier in these slides or from nutrition?

374
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:11,678
How many Kcals do you normally release with some fat?

375
00:41:13,219 --> 00:41:15,040
Around nine, nine, 9.5, right?

376
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:18,642
But the thing you have to be really careful about are the units.

377
00:41:20,023 --> 00:41:22,665
When we looked at this one here,

378
00:41:23,952 --> 00:41:32,036
These nutritional kind of calculations are four kcals per gram of your substrate.

379
00:41:32,596 --> 00:41:38,018
So per gram of carbohydrate, per gram of fat, and per gram of protein.

380
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:50,984
In these bomb kilometers, you have unlimited oxygen being pumped into here to fully combust that molecule.

381
00:41:53,774 --> 00:41:55,254
Our body's a little unique, right?

382
00:41:55,454 --> 00:41:58,775
We do not have unlimited oxygen in our tissues.

383
00:42:00,455 --> 00:42:11,697
When we get into some respiratory physiology and altitude, the problem or the name of the game is how do we get more oxygen into the blood to be transported to the tissues?

384
00:42:12,718 --> 00:42:17,818
So most of the time, the limiting factor is for us to actually have more oxygen in the tissues.

385
00:42:18,899 --> 00:42:20,259
So these calculations,

386
00:42:21,618 --> 00:42:24,419
or cake house per liter of oxygen.

387
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:49,727
Meaning, if I have one liter of oxygen, or I have that bomb climber and I only infuse one liter of oxygen, and I have unlimited fat, or a gram of fat, and I light that on fire, there's only enough oxygen, one liter of oxygen, to burn a portion of that fat.

388
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:55,725
What gets released is 4.69 kcal of energy.

389
00:42:57,686 --> 00:43:11,136
And if we're looking down at that substrate, the one gram of fat, well, maybe around half, a little bit less than half would be burnt and then there would be some fat remaining.

390
00:43:13,418 --> 00:43:20,703
Whereas carbohydrates, even though it's four kcal per gram, if I infuse one liter

391
00:43:22,692 --> 00:43:32,338
of oxygen, and I have two grams of carbohydrate, or unlimited grams of carbohydrate, and I light that on fire, you will burn one full gram plus some more.

392
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:35,800
Are we OK there?

393
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,722
All right.

394
00:43:39,863 --> 00:43:43,685
This is an important concept for the calculations you'll do next week.

395
00:43:45,867 --> 00:43:48,869
This week, we're just saying, don't worry about this right now.

396
00:43:49,449 --> 00:43:50,770
Just estimate it as five.

397
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:58,417
So when you're doing your held-in calculations for lab two, we say, use 5k cals per liter oxygen.

398
00:43:58,497 --> 00:44:03,420
Next week, you're going to have a really big chart where you can actually isolate different percentages.

399
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:06,182
Yeah?

400
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:13,826
No, no.

401
00:44:14,127 --> 00:44:20,771
Yeah, in this instance, it's just, how much energy can I liberate from your substrates?

402
00:44:22,338 --> 00:44:25,499
And we are limited in the amount of oxygen that we have.

403
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:44,227
This overall formula, the efficiency on how we are burning each substrate is dependent a little bit on the composition of the molecule itself.

404
00:44:45,572 --> 00:44:48,093
because there are kind of C6.

405
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,554
There are six carbons here.

406
00:44:49,614 --> 00:44:53,616
We have 16 over here, but it requires a little bit more oxygen to break this one down.

407
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,040
OK.

408
00:45:02,161 --> 00:45:03,162
Any other questions on this?

409
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:09,645
I don't mind spending more time on this because this is a really good foundational standpoint that we need to make sure we're good here.

410
00:45:12,767 --> 00:45:12,867
OK.

411
00:45:14,677 --> 00:45:16,297
Energy requirements at rest.

412
00:45:17,638 --> 00:45:27,620
If I'm at rest, does anyone remember what we would estimate someone's resting either energy expenditure or oxygen consumption to be?

413
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,141
Any ideas?

414
00:45:32,541 --> 00:45:36,682
If someone were to be resting, yeah.

415
00:45:36,762 --> 00:45:38,783
Yeah, 3.5 milliliters per kilogram per minute.

416
00:45:39,223 --> 00:45:40,623
Does anyone know what that equals?

417
00:45:41,664 --> 00:45:42,144
One something.

418
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,161
Yeah, one met.

419
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:44,681
Yep.

420
00:45:45,522 --> 00:45:45,762
OK.

421
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:58,474
So at rest, almost, it's never always at 100, but most of the ATP produced by aerobic metabolism is at rest.

422
00:45:59,735 --> 00:46:03,279
Blood lactate levels are low, but it does vary between individuals.

423
00:46:04,449 --> 00:46:07,411
And we would say it's around 0.25 liters per minute.

424
00:46:07,451 --> 00:46:09,493
But again, this depends on body size.

425
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:15,337
If we accounted for body size, everyone should be around 3.5 milliliters per kilogram per minute.

426
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,961
OK, so you're all resting.

427
00:46:20,501 --> 00:46:21,842
You're kind of relaxing.

428
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:22,663
And then you're like, you know what?

429
00:46:23,443 --> 00:46:24,324
Time to exercise.

430
00:46:25,605 --> 00:46:28,888
So let's see what happens when we move from rest to exercise.

431
00:46:29,812 --> 00:46:33,254
Well, ATP production increases immediately.

432
00:46:33,854 --> 00:46:39,237
No surprise, because the amount of ATP that we store inside our body, it's quite low.

433
00:46:39,837 --> 00:46:41,318
So we have to replenish those stores.

434
00:46:42,538 --> 00:46:44,379
We've kind of seen this concept already.

435
00:46:44,619 --> 00:46:58,206
If we have PCR concentration on the y here and time on the x, these concentrations drop pretty rapidly, because we are undergoing the ATP-PC cycle.

436
00:47:00,221 --> 00:47:07,887
So initially, ATP production is through these non-oxidated pathways, ATP, phosphocreatine, and glycolysis.

437
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:12,651
This is kind of just depicted over here.

438
00:47:16,034 --> 00:47:16,615
That's review.

439
00:47:16,975 --> 00:47:18,056
We've already talked about that.

440
00:47:18,316 --> 00:47:18,816
No big deal.

441
00:47:22,379 --> 00:47:28,745
Here, those who had lab on Monday or you've reviewed those slides, this should look very familiar.

442
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:55,254
But if I'm resting and someone turns on the treadmill and the treadmill is going at a certain speed, say seven miles per hour, and I jump on that treadmill, the body requires this much ATP to be produced per second in order for me to sustain that speed to run.

443
00:47:58,096 --> 00:48:02,839
But right here on the y-axis, we have oxygen consumption.

444
00:48:06,681 --> 00:48:09,083
This is how much oxygen we are consuming.

445
00:48:09,203 --> 00:48:13,025
And it doesn't take or it takes approximately three minutes.

446
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:16,747
There's a lag in the amount of oxygen we can consume.

447
00:48:17,748 --> 00:48:20,310
So here it takes around three minutes.

448
00:48:21,288 --> 00:48:30,233
before I'm consuming enough energy to generate or consuming enough oxygen to generate ATP to sustain this workload?

449
00:48:34,035 --> 00:48:42,700
Well, if I'm not producing enough ATP here, how then am I staying on the treadmill and not just flying off the back?

450
00:48:51,286 --> 00:48:55,307
And you've probably experienced this before, not flying off the back of the treadmill.

451
00:48:55,327 --> 00:49:01,149
But if you run to class, while you're running, if it's short enough, you probably feel OK.

452
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:07,490
And then you sit down, and all of a sudden your heart rate is spiking, your ventilation is pretty high, and it takes a little bit to kind of relax.

453
00:49:09,311 --> 00:49:18,373
So how did I run for three minutes with not a lot of oxidative phosphorylation going on?

454
00:49:19,771 --> 00:49:21,352
How am I generating that energy then?

455
00:49:23,853 --> 00:49:25,474
Yeah, the anaerobic metabolism.

456
00:49:25,694 --> 00:49:33,518
So this portion right here, this shaded area above the curve is called O2 deficit.

457
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:47,186
The O2 deficit is representing the immediate or the non-oxidative energy sources that we now had to kind of consume or burn in order to sustain this ATP up here.

458
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,008
Are we okay with this concept here?

459
00:49:59,309 --> 00:49:59,529
Nice.

460
00:50:02,191 --> 00:50:21,662
The nice thing about this curve here, how quickly we reach this steady state is typically determined by either fitness or other kind of metabolic disorders, but as we start training,

461
00:50:23,275 --> 00:50:27,716
you start to get a faster rise in the oxygen consumption.

462
00:50:30,197 --> 00:50:40,340
So this teal line here on the left is representing an individual who has undergone some type of endurance training program.

463
00:50:41,221 --> 00:50:43,821
And it shifted this kind of curve to the left.

464
00:50:44,882 --> 00:50:48,743
So this is before training, and this is after training.

465
00:50:52,616 --> 00:51:02,286
If I were to shade this then, so if I were to draw a line across the top up here and then shade all of this, that would be the O2 deficit after training.

466
00:51:03,127 --> 00:51:08,793
And then if I were to shade all of this, this would be the O2 deficit before training.

467
00:51:10,562 --> 00:51:16,404
So no surprise then, the O2 deficit is lower following training.

468
00:51:17,044 --> 00:51:25,787
That means the rise in oxygen consumption or the rate at which you are increasing oxygen consumption is faster after training.

469
00:51:29,068 --> 00:51:32,409
Same VO2 at a lower concentration of ADP.

470
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:40,332
And we can meet a lot of the ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation.

471
00:51:43,035 --> 00:51:52,940
We don't get into this concept too much more than this in this class, but this is a whole field of exercise physiology called VO2 kinetics.

472
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,501
It's a pretty fascinating field.

473
00:51:56,601 --> 00:52:01,184
There used to be this idea that you would have three determinants of performance, VO2 max.

474
00:52:02,144 --> 00:52:03,624
economy and lactate threshold.

475
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:13,086
And if you had at least two of the three at a relatively high level, you'd be kind of a very elite athlete or an Olympic performer.

476
00:52:13,966 --> 00:52:23,828
And if you had all three that were at the top, then those are kind of those athletes who, Olympic after Olympic, they're just always kind of winning golds and silvers.

477
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:27,349
So typically, we don't see athletes with all three of those.

478
00:52:27,929 --> 00:52:31,350
But now they're adding like a fourth pillar, and that's VO2 kinetics.

479
00:52:32,405 --> 00:52:36,009
So it's how quickly can you get to that point.

480
00:52:37,631 --> 00:52:41,937
OK, this results in less lactate formation and hydrogen production.

481
00:52:42,718 --> 00:52:47,924
The other really big thing is you are not depleting your immediate energy sources as much.

482
00:52:49,045 --> 00:52:49,987
So this is very nice.

483
00:52:52,807 --> 00:53:00,614
Right here, not that big of a deal, but you could imagine an athlete who would want to rely on those immediate energy sources throughout the race.

484
00:53:00,794 --> 00:53:02,155
Maybe they wanna speed up a little bit.

485
00:53:02,195 --> 00:53:03,556
Maybe they wanna sprint at the end.

486
00:53:09,742 --> 00:53:10,002
Okay.

487
00:53:11,624 --> 00:53:15,547
Metabolic responses to exercise, influence of duration and intensity.

488
00:53:16,848 --> 00:53:19,671
When we are talking about substrate utilization,

489
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:29,603
and looking at RER, you always have to ask yourself, how does this behave if I increase or decrease duration?

490
00:53:31,046 --> 00:53:35,567
And separately, how does this behave if I increase or decrease intensity?

491
00:53:36,267 --> 00:53:37,848
These are two separate topics.

492
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:39,968
Yes, they sometimes are.

493
00:53:40,469 --> 00:53:44,150
Like if I increase duration, a lot of the times you have to back off on intensity.

494
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:49,591
But these two concepts are just so much easier to try to grasp if you separate them.

495
00:53:50,031 --> 00:53:51,532
And then later on we can put them together.

496
00:53:55,073 --> 00:54:00,234
And so the interaction between oxidative and non-oxidative ATP production

497
00:54:02,163 --> 00:54:06,185
would be this idea of short-term high-intensity exercise.

498
00:54:06,525 --> 00:54:12,267
You're going to have a greater contribution from those non-oxidative or anaerobic energy systems.

499
00:54:13,408 --> 00:54:23,692
The long-term or low to moderate exercise intensity would then rely majorly on the ATP being produced from aerobic sources.

500
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:36,012
This is a really great figure to just double check that you understand the concept from this slide here.

501
00:54:37,093 --> 00:54:50,157
So if you look at this figure, if I'm trying to sprint for one to three seconds, essentially it's not 100, but it's like 99.99999, right?

502
00:54:51,878 --> 00:54:55,819
That is primarily gonna come from anaerobic or non-oxidative.

503
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:58,891
as I move down the spectrum here.

504
00:55:00,453 --> 00:55:12,082
Even if I'm sprinting for two minutes, 60% of the energy is still coming from non-oxidative, but 40% is coming from oxidative.

505
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:17,947
Once we get into this three minute mark, we're almost 50-50.

506
00:55:19,889 --> 00:55:21,110
And then at four minutes,

507
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:37,222
You're kind of on the other side of the spectrum now, where you're at 65, maybe 70, 30, as far as 70 being primarily, or not primarily, majority of that energy is coming from oxidative phosphorylation.

508
00:55:40,505 --> 00:55:42,207
And this four minutes is kind of unique because

509
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:53,755
most people would think, if I'm trying to sprint a mile as fast as I can, that maybe a lot of that is coming from non-oxidated phosphorylation.

510
00:55:54,295 --> 00:56:08,702
And I know not everyone can run four-minute miles, but in general, even if you were trying to sprint for four minutes, there is a substantial contribution from the oxidative phosphorylation to that exercise task.

511
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:21,065
So try to make sure you keep this in the back of your mind here that just because you're running four minutes or five minutes doesn't mean it's not oxidative.

512
00:56:21,566 --> 00:56:29,515
It doesn't always have to be 10K, a marathon for it to be kind of primarily on the oxidative side of things.

513
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:42,988
You definitely don't need to memorize these, but it might be good to kind of check these to get an idea of how long some of these events are.

514
00:56:43,468 --> 00:56:46,170
So 10 minutes, that's close to a two mile run.

515
00:56:48,012 --> 00:56:50,474
Two minutes, 800 meter dash.

516
00:56:51,895 --> 00:56:56,559
On a track, on a standard track, not an indoor track, does anyone know how many laps that is?

517
00:56:57,882 --> 00:56:58,723
800 meters, too.

518
00:56:59,003 --> 00:56:59,163
Yeah.

519
00:56:59,364 --> 00:57:00,705
So if you just run around twice.

520
00:57:01,105 --> 00:57:02,006
So it's not very far.

521
00:57:02,887 --> 00:57:03,647
Run around twice.

522
00:57:04,348 --> 00:57:05,549
That should be your 800 meters.

523
00:57:10,185 --> 00:57:11,645
Here are some more examples here.

524
00:57:11,765 --> 00:57:19,767
Again, I wouldn't focus on memorizing these events per se, but you could always just kind of quiz yourself.

525
00:57:19,847 --> 00:57:24,108
OK, if I'm going out for a 5k, around what percentage?

526
00:57:24,168 --> 00:57:29,609
Well, you wouldn't have to memorize the percentage, but are you using more oxidative or are you using more non-oxidative?

527
00:57:29,629 --> 00:57:31,170
And kind of look down here.

528
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:31,750
Well, this is a 5k.

529
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:37,092
And so we're not using a lot of ATP, PC, or glycolysis.

530
00:57:37,252 --> 00:57:38,153
70% aerobic, OK.

531
00:57:38,813 --> 00:57:39,594
That kind of makes sense.

532
00:57:39,614 --> 00:57:42,476
So that means 10K would probably be more than that.

533
00:57:43,876 --> 00:57:47,238
So that's how you should approach these figures here, these tables here.

534
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:50,800
OK.

535
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:54,663
Short-term, high-intensity exercise.

536
00:57:55,963 --> 00:58:02,008
This is, I'm gonna go through these kind of fast, because it's a little bit of review first, one to five seconds is through the ATPPC.

537
00:58:02,889 --> 00:58:05,911
Then you kind of shift the ATP production to glycolysis.

538
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:15,820
And then anything lasting longer than 45 seconds, you're starting to really rely on that oxidative phosphorylation.

539
00:58:17,241 --> 00:58:22,345
Even at 60 seconds, right, we're at 70, 30, and then two to three minutes, we're already at that 50, 50.

540
00:58:27,043 --> 00:58:32,367
I can then plot these on a figure as far as contribution from each energy system.

541
00:58:35,330 --> 00:58:37,391
Here you can see the teal line.

542
00:58:37,471 --> 00:58:40,514
So we have contribution of energy system on the y-axis.

543
00:58:40,774 --> 00:58:44,437
And then we have time in seconds of maximal effort.

544
00:58:44,477 --> 00:58:47,139
So it's not like, oh, I'm walking for three seconds.

545
00:58:47,239 --> 00:58:51,383
No, you're doing the maximum effort you can for that duration.

546
00:58:52,481 --> 00:58:53,962
So this is seconds down here.

547
00:58:54,722 --> 00:58:57,123
This teal line is the ATP PC system.

548
00:58:57,483 --> 00:59:05,748
You'll notice it's not at 100% because we still have some energy contribution from both aerobic and glycolysis.

549
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:11,851
So the rapid non-oxidative glycolysis as well as the oxidative phosphorylation right here in blue.

550
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:16,293
As we move in duration,

551
00:59:18,212 --> 00:59:24,957
the contribution from these systems, primarily because you're depleting them, rapidly decrease.

552
00:59:26,978 --> 00:59:33,883
We become more reliant on these other energy systems as we move through the duration.

553
00:59:43,229 --> 00:59:43,329
OK.

554
00:59:49,129 --> 00:59:54,092
I probably should have put this question in a different place.

555
00:59:54,192 --> 01:00:01,676
But here's a question I want you to kind of chat with your neighbors about.

556
01:00:04,397 --> 01:00:10,601
If we are talking about substrate utilization where 0.7 is 100% fat, 1 would be 100% carbohydrate,

557
01:00:15,498 --> 01:00:24,806
Would it be physiologically possible for the respiratory exchange ratio to be outside of the R or the RQ range of 0.7 to 1?

558
01:00:26,888 --> 01:00:28,910
So chat with your classmates really quick.

559
01:00:32,674 --> 01:00:34,095
And we'll come back to this.

560
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:33,064
Okay, sorry, the timing of this slide wasn't great, because I probably should have had it maybe three or four slides back when we were talking about RER, but it's good review.

561
01:02:34,326 --> 01:02:37,310
If we look at the RER chart, which you will see next week,

562
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:45,302
you see this is an expanded version of that table where we go from 0.7 all the way to one.

563
01:02:46,283 --> 01:02:56,645
Even this chart is simplifying things because we can get at like six decimal places deep on this RER chart when we're actually doing substrate calculations for athletes.

564
01:02:57,425 --> 01:03:03,106
So even this is a little bit of a simplified version of the RER chart.

565
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:14,347
But if I'm at 100% carbohydrates and 100% fats, and that's 0.7 to 1, do you think we can go over 1?

566
01:03:14,387 --> 01:03:21,692
So I'm seeing some shakes of the head.

567
01:03:21,712 --> 01:03:25,895
How about we'll start with this.

568
01:03:26,056 --> 01:03:27,036
Can you go lower than 0.7?

569
01:03:29,592 --> 01:03:37,657
No, I'm thinking no because, again, you have a required amount of oxygen to break down these lipids or these free fatty acids.

570
01:03:38,498 --> 01:03:44,562
And that doesn't change because the stoichiometry behind it is what it is.

571
01:03:44,622 --> 01:03:45,782
You just can't change that.

572
01:03:47,624 --> 01:03:53,207
But over here, then, you can make the same argument for the carbohydrates, for the glucose molecule.

573
01:03:56,489 --> 01:03:56,730
But.

574
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:01,723
It's the respiratory exchange ratio, not what's happening at the muscle.

575
01:04:03,905 --> 01:04:05,206
So what are we counting again?

576
01:04:06,647 --> 01:04:09,349
The number of what over the number of what?

577
01:04:09,509 --> 01:04:10,149
What's RER?

578
01:04:12,211 --> 01:04:16,935
VCO2 over VO2, right?

579
01:04:17,255 --> 01:04:23,420
The amount of oxygen we consume, I'm gonna argue that doesn't change very much if we're down over there.

580
01:04:27,175 --> 01:04:34,761
Any idea if we could produce carbon dioxide not from breaking down the substrate?

581
01:04:37,523 --> 01:04:40,686
Someone mentioned it last week, so maybe that person don't mention it, but.

582
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:49,513
Is there another way where our body produces an excess quantity of

583
01:04:52,526 --> 01:04:56,768
Yeah, so all of the carbon dioxide produced here is from cellular respiration.

584
01:04:57,688 --> 01:04:58,568
Yeah, that's a good thought.

585
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:00,669
But outside of cellular respiration.

586
01:05:00,689 --> 01:05:04,311
Do you have a guess?

587
01:05:05,831 --> 01:05:07,252
Yeah, the bicarbonate buffer.

588
01:05:08,392 --> 01:05:13,034
So we can have non-metabolically produced carbon dioxide.

589
01:05:15,567 --> 01:05:20,389
We cannot dissociate the two when we are measuring expired gases.

590
01:05:21,409 --> 01:05:30,153
So when you are running through your RER calculations next week, not likely, but it's possible that someone will be over one.

591
01:05:31,534 --> 01:05:34,995
And if that's the case, you need to think about, well, one, is that possible?

592
01:05:35,215 --> 01:05:37,276
Yes, I'm telling you it's possible, but two, why?

593
01:05:38,216 --> 01:05:39,197
And the second one would be,

594
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:42,983
Well, you're producing more non-metabolically.

595
01:05:43,704 --> 01:05:50,171
And if you're undergoing that bicarb buffering, that means there are a lot of hydrogen ions, or there's a lot of changes in the pH.

596
01:05:50,552 --> 01:05:52,354
And so that intensity must be pretty high.

597
01:05:58,381 --> 01:05:59,763
OK, any questions on that one?

598
01:06:02,197 --> 01:06:05,258
All right, so we'll get into this concept.

599
01:06:05,619 --> 01:06:10,121
Now we're kind of jumping back, sorry about that, but steady state or prolonged exercise.

600
01:06:10,141 --> 01:06:13,022
So this is the duration piece of the exercise.

601
01:06:13,662 --> 01:06:16,444
So metabolic responses to prolonged exercise.

602
01:06:17,624 --> 01:06:25,150
When we are looking at these concepts, especially this one, we usually need to make sure we're kind of in a cool environment.

603
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:27,972
Some of these things change if I heat up the room.

604
01:06:28,692 --> 01:06:33,055
So we'll just start with a thermo neutral environment, cool environment.

605
01:06:34,396 --> 01:06:40,881
The ATP production will be primarily from oxidative phosphorylation or aerobic metabolism.

606
01:06:42,362 --> 01:06:44,404
And we can maintain a steady state

607
01:06:45,572 --> 01:06:52,577
as long, again, as we are below lactate threshold or it's a submaximal exercise.

608
01:06:57,461 --> 01:07:11,471
If I heat up the room though, so this is exercise in a hot and humid environment versus exercise in a cool environment, you will get an upward drift of oxygen uptake, even if I don't change the workload or the power.

609
01:07:14,649 --> 01:07:16,010
One day, I will change these figures.

610
01:07:16,071 --> 01:07:21,316
But I really don't like these figures only because they make it seem like both are increasing.

611
01:07:21,836 --> 01:07:24,158
But you have to kind of look at the axes here.

612
01:07:24,959 --> 01:07:27,902
Maybe it's a good learning tool here.

613
01:07:27,962 --> 01:07:30,424
But the axes here, you go from 1.2 to 2.4.

614
01:07:30,825 --> 01:07:33,227
And over here, you're going from 2 to 3.6.

615
01:07:35,109 --> 01:07:37,952
So they've kind of shrunk down the axes in this picture.

616
01:07:39,102 --> 01:07:47,808
And if we're looking at this change, this increase here or this increase is only like point one, maybe point two.

617
01:07:49,109 --> 01:07:54,673
If I were to put point one on this graph, it would be from here to like here.

618
01:07:57,215 --> 01:08:03,860
So there's a really big increase after 20 minutes of exercise in the heat.

619
01:08:05,424 --> 01:08:13,411
But after the same, let's see here, 40, maybe 40 minutes of exercise in the cool, we're basically pretty flat.

620
01:08:17,374 --> 01:08:25,722
So if I heat up the room and make it more humid, you get an upward drift in oxygen uptake over time, and you cannot achieve steady state.

621
01:08:28,672 --> 01:08:37,416
We'll touch on this when we get to hormones, but a lot of this is because you have an increase in core body temperature as well as an increase in epinephrine or epinephrine secretion.

622
01:08:45,139 --> 01:08:52,902
Okay, assuming you can maintain steady state in a cool environment, if I increase duration,

623
01:08:55,523 --> 01:09:04,530
prolonged low intensity exercise, you shift from carbohydrate metabolism to fat metabolism.

624
01:09:06,872 --> 01:09:20,562
Again, if I am only looking at exercise duration here, you are shifting from carbohydrate metabolism towards fat metabolism.

625
01:09:25,752 --> 01:09:27,354
Any questions on this concept here?

626
01:09:29,596 --> 01:09:29,916
OK.

627
01:09:31,017 --> 01:09:34,540
So be a good clicker to end with, because you know the deal now.

628
01:09:35,561 --> 01:09:46,652
So if we're shifting that way, what happens to R or RER as exercise duration increases?

629
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:03,627
We'll go about a minute from now, maybe a little less.

630
01:10:46,178 --> 01:10:48,359
Okay, let's double check that you have an answer in.

631
01:10:48,379 --> 01:10:55,642
I think we're missing 10 clickers.

632
01:10:56,903 --> 01:11:02,625
You could be that last clicker that makes or breaks this question.

633
01:11:06,747 --> 01:11:11,369
Two clickers will go maybe 10 seconds from now.

634
01:11:12,189 --> 01:11:14,090
One clicker, double check you're in.

635
01:11:15,329 --> 01:11:20,152
All right, I'll close it down in three, two, one.

636
01:11:20,172 --> 01:11:26,796
Nice job, we did pretty good here.

637
01:11:29,798 --> 01:11:31,980
So we're thinking B here.

638
01:11:39,645 --> 01:11:41,106
What does the RER chart go from?

639
01:11:41,126 --> 01:11:44,107
0.7 to one, what's that 0.7?

640
01:11:46,578 --> 01:11:47,499
100% fat, what's that one?

641
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:49,340
100% carbs.

642
01:11:49,701 --> 01:11:54,304
As I increase in exercise duration, we shift from what substrate to what?

643
01:11:55,325 --> 01:12:03,310
From carbs to fat, so that means we kind of move, well, I know I'm going up, but you move like down towards the point seven, right?

644
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:07,533
So, that's this piece here.

645
01:12:09,095 --> 01:12:13,378
As I am going more towards fat, you're going lower on the RER.

646
01:12:15,306 --> 01:12:19,133
Okay, we'll start basically on this concept on Thursday.

647
01:12:19,153 --> 01:12:21,678
Have a great rest of your day.
