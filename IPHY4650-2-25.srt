1
00:02:50,148 --> 00:02:51,109
Okay.

2
00:02:53,052 --> 00:02:55,075
Welcome back everyone.

3
00:02:56,938 --> 00:02:59,622
What a great, what a great day, right?

4
00:02:59,622 --> 00:03:02,547
This week is starting to get warmer.

5
00:03:02,547 --> 00:03:04,029
It's pretty nice.

6
00:03:04,029 --> 00:03:05,351
I always like the weather.

7
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,352
Weather's pretty good.

8
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,314
It's a good time of the year.

9
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:10,979
It's like super cold and it's getting a little warmer.

10
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:13,621
The days are getting a little longer.

11
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:14,562
It's a great time.

12
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:15,423
Great time.

13
00:03:15,423 --> 00:03:16,344
OK.

14
00:03:16,344 --> 00:03:27,336
So on Thursday, we left off talking about fiber typing, so how we have different proteins that,

15
00:03:27,336 --> 00:03:31,360
depending on how they are coded, have different

16
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:38,275
properties or force-producing properties, and we label them different fiber types.

17
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:42,159
You know, type 1, type 2a, type 2x.

18
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,121
And then we talked about type 2b.

19
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:48,765
Do humans express type 2b fibers?

20
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:50,807
No.

21
00:03:50,807 --> 00:03:51,087
No.

22
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:59,315
We have the proteins or the genes for them, but we don't actually express some of those genes.

23
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:03,499
And we typically don't have those proteins as well,

24
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:07,843
unless you're in some rare instances with muscular dystrophy.

25
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:12,665
Okay, so today we're gonna basically pick up where we

26
00:04:12,665 --> 00:04:17,314
left off there and talk about force regulation in the muscle.

27
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:19,818
So we just got done talking about fiber typing,

28
00:04:19,818 --> 00:04:23,545
but then there becomes this little situation where, to be

29
00:04:23,545 --> 00:04:30,658
honest, does fiber typing really matter if everything is being controlled at the neuromuscular level?

30
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:35,392
So clearly they are different fiber types, but how

31
00:04:35,392 --> 00:04:42,560
we regulate when the muscles actually contract are from neuromuscular activity.

32
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:47,166
So we're gonna touch into force regulation in muscle.

33
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,208
We'll talk about three major pieces.

34
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:54,334
We'll start with the first one, which is the type and number of motor units recruited.

35
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:59,957
So if you recruit more motor units, you are going

36
00:04:59,957 --> 00:05:05,583
to produce a greater force, independent of muscle fiber type, right?

37
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:09,948
Like if you're just recruiting more muscles in general, you're gonna produce more force.

38
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:17,216
If you have fast motor units, those typically are

39
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:24,203
more associated with producing or activating fiber types that have a greater force.

40
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,445
Okay, so if we're talking about motor units and different

41
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:33,531
types of motor units, let's get into that as well.

42
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:39,521
So here we have the type S, or the slow motor units.

43
00:05:40,722 --> 00:05:47,874
These are the smallest of the motor neurons, and they typically innervate type I muscle fibers.

44
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:53,262
Then we move down to type FR,

45
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:56,859
or fast fatigue resistant.

46
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:02,585
These are typically innervating the type 2a muscle fibers.

47
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:09,492
And then lastly would be the type FF, or the fast fatigable.

48
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:14,657
These are considered the largest of the motor units,

49
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:21,004
and they typically are innervating the type 2x muscle fibers.

50
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:26,865
Now this is the only piece where we start to get in

51
00:06:26,865 --> 00:06:30,594
a little bit of a discrepancy or maybe a debate

52
00:06:30,594 --> 00:06:33,761
between the neurophysiology side and the exercise physiology.

53
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:39,355
If you read a exercise physiology textbook, this is exactly what's

54
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:42,871
in there, but if you go to the neurophysiology textbook,

55
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:45,938
They would almost suggest there's no discrimination between the

56
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:49,066
motor units and the fiber types that they're innervating.

57
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:51,873
There is a distinction between the slow fast fatigue

58
00:06:51,873 --> 00:06:59,732
resistance and the fast fatigable, but that they innervate an equal proportion of type 1 versus type 2.

59
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:09,732
We are gonna go off of this particular model just because your textbook is going off of that.

60
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:15,586
And there's some evidence to suggest that something like this might be happening.

61
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:18,051
And we'll talk about that in a little bit as well.

62
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:20,016
So just know that this isn't like,

63
00:07:21,177 --> 00:07:22,739
The end all be all, right?

64
00:07:22,739 --> 00:07:25,842
There are other kind of concepts out there suggesting

65
00:07:25,842 --> 00:07:28,704
that yes, there are these three different types of motor

66
00:07:28,704 --> 00:07:32,508
units, but they're all kind of innervating different fiber types in equal proportions.

67
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:38,934
Okay, recruitment pattern during graded exercise.

68
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:43,299
If we have a graded exercise test, what's increasing on the x-axis?

69
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:47,843
I think I heard it, but.

70
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:50,520
I can get a few brave volunteers.

71
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,544
What's increasing on the x-axis with the graded exercise test?

72
00:07:57,631 --> 00:07:59,674
Intensity, thank you, thank you.

73
00:07:59,674 --> 00:08:03,420
All right, so if it's increasing with intensity, then we

74
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:10,811
are doing more work with every kind of grade for that exercise.

75
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:13,375
So we're gonna start with the type S.

76
00:08:14,283 --> 00:08:19,889
moved to the type FR, so slow, fatigue resistant, and the fast fatigueable.

77
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:26,476
And that tracks with what we were just talking about with type one all the way to type 2X.

78
00:08:33,383 --> 00:08:33,504
Okay.

79
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:37,127
We'll touch on Twitch and rate of fatigue in a little

80
00:08:37,127 --> 00:08:42,553
bit, but I wouldn't really worry too much about the distinction in these ones.

81
00:08:42,553 --> 00:08:44,287
Just know

82
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:48,634
I guess the level of recruitment and typically when you

83
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:55,965
are recruiting each motor neuron during a graded exercise test, which will be on this next slide here.

84
00:08:56,966 --> 00:09:01,253
So typically the recruitment pattern during graded exercise tests, as I mentioned,

85
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:05,660
was type one to type two A to type two X. Well

86
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,926
then that would be the S and then the fatigue resistance.

87
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:13,011
So the slow fatigue resistant and the fast fatigueable.

88
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:22,474
Keep in mind though, if I am doing maximal exercise or this

89
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:32,012
exercise in here at 80 to 100%, all of these muscle fibers are being activated.

90
00:09:35,536 --> 00:09:39,240
So if I wanted to produce the most force, it would

91
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,464
make sense to me that I would recruit every single fiber

92
00:09:43,464 --> 00:09:47,568
that I potentially could recruit so I could generate the most amount of force.

93
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,974
It's not that you're at 100% or you're doing a maximal

94
00:09:52,974 --> 00:09:57,038
exercise and only the type 2x fibers are recruiting.

95
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:04,986
Well, to me, that wouldn't be as advantageous because the type 1 fibers are still producing force.

96
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:12,989
So at 100% active muscle fibers, all of these are being activated.

97
00:10:16,094 --> 00:10:20,520
This should help with the sizing principle concept, which is this next slide here.

98
00:10:22,943 --> 00:10:28,491
So low force on this x-axis going to high force production,

99
00:10:28,491 --> 00:10:36,282
and low recruitment all the way up to high recruitment.

100
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:37,504
If I am recruiting,

101
00:10:39,256 --> 00:10:44,622
low or a low number of these motor neurons and the

102
00:10:44,622 --> 00:10:47,406
units that are smaller, then I'm gonna produce a lower force.

103
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:51,450
But I'm gonna produce the most force if I can activate everything.

104
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,514
But they go on this kind of continuum, this little spectrum.

105
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:59,940
So progressive recruitment of motor units begins with the

106
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,065
smallest motor units and progresses to larger and larger motor neurons.

107
00:11:11,656 --> 00:11:12,838
Are we OK so far?

108
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:17,126
Yeah.

109
00:11:17,126 --> 00:11:18,609
But we're still at the high point.

110
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:21,173
We're still recruiting the small motors.

111
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:22,335
Yeah, yeah.

112
00:11:22,335 --> 00:11:25,040
Yeah, this is more of a continuum.

113
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,585
So you're moving along this continuum, but it's not like

114
00:11:27,585 --> 00:11:30,130
you're turning off the smaller ones down here.

115
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:30,931
Yeah.

116
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:31,111
Good.

117
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:33,175
Now.

118
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,134
There's one caveat where there is some cycling going on

119
00:11:37,134 --> 00:11:45,446
because obviously you can't have a motor unit continuously firing signals forever.

120
00:11:45,446 --> 00:11:47,729
Eventually it's possible, right?

121
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:52,075
These motor neurons and the muscle fibers are fatigable, right?

122
00:11:52,075 --> 00:11:55,921
So it will cycle through them, but essentially they're

123
00:11:55,921 --> 00:12:00,748
active all the way throughout if we're trying to produce a very short-term high-intensity bow.

124
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,427
Okay, the relationship between stimulus strength and force of contraction.

125
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:17,619
If I increase the stimulus strength, then you are also going to increase the force of contraction.

126
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:25,693
A stronger signal is potentially going to recruit more

127
00:12:26,714 --> 00:12:30,060
muscle fibers, which is going to reduce into more force.

128
00:12:38,647 --> 00:12:39,069
All right.

129
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:44,134
Let's see how we're doing with this.

130
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,970
And you can think of maybe primarily or a larger quantity.

131
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:14,897
Is it not on?

132
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:38,945
So if your clicker wasn't working, it should be good now.

133
00:14:40,168 --> 00:14:42,715
Let's try another 45 seconds or so.

134
00:15:17,052 --> 00:15:18,875
OK, 10 seconds here.

135
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:23,182
Anyone need a little more time?

136
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:33,899
OK, I'll close it down in five, three, two, one.

137
00:15:36,543 --> 00:15:37,304
OK, how did we do?

138
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:41,170
Nice job.

139
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,490
So C is the correct answer.

140
00:15:52,692 --> 00:15:56,476
We typically are not producing a ton of force in the

141
00:15:56,476 --> 00:16:02,403
eye, right, compared to a, if we're looking at the rectus femoris muscle.

142
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:08,810
So C, slow and the fast fatigable would be the correct answer there.

143
00:16:13,596 --> 00:16:15,458
Okay.

144
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,261
Force regulation in the muscle number two.

145
00:16:19,473 --> 00:16:24,921
The initial muscle length is also going to influence

146
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:27,305
how much force the muscle can actually produce.

147
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:32,612
There is an ideal length to be able to produce that force.

148
00:16:34,195 --> 00:16:38,621
And this is inherently behind the concept of the cross-bridge formation.

149
00:16:39,883 --> 00:16:42,707
If I'm in a certain length where I don't have the

150
00:16:42,707 --> 00:16:48,110
maximum number of cross-bridges that are able to form in that given time point,

151
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,557
then you're not gonna be able to produce as much force compared to that optimal overlap.

152
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,865
And you may have seen this length tension relationship

153
00:16:56,865 --> 00:17:03,957
for skeletal muscle, where if you have three different muscle

154
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:06,661
lengths, and we can think of these as different positions.

155
00:17:06,661 --> 00:17:09,145
So maybe this is one position, this is another position,

156
00:17:09,145 --> 00:17:11,890
and then this is that third position on the end there.

157
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:16,217
This third position is kind of easy to start with because

158
00:17:16,217 --> 00:17:24,866
if you look at the overlap between the myosin and the actin, it's not very high, right?

159
00:17:24,866 --> 00:17:28,530
Like if I'm all the way extended like this and I try to grab something

160
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,134
and it's pretty heavy and I try to lift it up, it's

161
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:39,042
gonna be a lot harder than if I start maybe halfway or where I'm having optimal overlap.

162
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:45,656
This would be the same deal if I start having, if I

163
00:17:45,656 --> 00:17:48,921
start going all the way over and it's like double overlapped and

164
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:51,965
it's still gonna be a little bit of a problem.

165
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,612
Meaning there's nowhere to really move.

166
00:17:57,633 --> 00:18:02,160
Like I can't really generate any force if I'm starting in this position right here.

167
00:18:08,873 --> 00:18:13,279
Number three, nature of the neural stimulation of the motor units.

168
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,004
This is where we're gonna talk about the frequency of stimulation.

169
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:20,388
We're gonna touch on a simple twitch summation in tetanus.

170
00:18:24,874 --> 00:18:24,994
Okay.

171
00:18:24,994 --> 00:18:27,617
So the reason why we talk about this is because a

172
00:18:27,617 --> 00:18:34,206
lot of the times they'll pull out a muscle fiber, put it on a force transducer and kind of stimulate it.

173
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,503
And when they stimulate it like that, a lot of times they can get twitches.

174
00:18:40,324 --> 00:18:42,707
But we need to be careful because normal

175
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:48,553
body movements, they're sustained contractions and they're not really dealing with simple twitches.

176
00:18:51,176 --> 00:18:55,200
But if we can repeatedly activate the muscle, then we

177
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:02,488
can start getting some results that are more similar to what we deal with with muscular contractions.

178
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:08,921
So a contraction is the result of a single stimulus.

179
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:13,248
So if I have a twitch here, there will be some

180
00:19:13,248 --> 00:19:17,634
delay because obviously that signal needs to reach the muscle fibers.

181
00:19:18,435 --> 00:19:22,080
And then you will have a contraction and a relaxation phase.

182
00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:25,345
The muscle contracts and then it relaxes.

183
00:19:27,107 --> 00:19:30,869
If we were to zoom in on this bottom piece right here,

184
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:34,214
then we can look at the three phases of a muscle twitch.

185
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:37,919
The first one will be this latent period.

186
00:19:39,622 --> 00:19:44,028
Again, we have to wait for that signal to get to the bottom of the motor end unit.

187
00:19:44,028 --> 00:19:46,632
Then it has to send that signal across the

188
00:19:46,632 --> 00:19:50,819
sarcolemma, down the T-tubule, sarcoplasmic reticulum, cross-bridge, right?

189
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:52,441
There's some sort of delay there.

190
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,523
It's not instant.

191
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:58,274
But as soon as that calcium reaches,

192
00:19:58,274 --> 00:20:01,538
opens those sites, and then you have the cross-bridges

193
00:20:01,538 --> 00:20:03,701
that form, you're going to generate a contraction.

194
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:10,509
Well, eventually, that signal, right, if it was just one simple twitch,

195
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:14,694
that signal is going to disappear, and then the calcium

196
00:20:14,694 --> 00:20:16,897
is going to be re-uptaked, and then you're going to

197
00:20:16,897 --> 00:20:21,042
have the cross-bridges no longer formed, and then you're going to have relaxation.

198
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:36,100
But as we start to get multiple twitches, we can see something pretty interesting here.

199
00:20:37,543 --> 00:20:45,676
If I increase the frequency of the stimulus, this results in some summation of those twitches.

200
00:20:45,676 --> 00:20:49,782
So here, on the x-axis, we have the stimuli.

201
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:53,708
So maybe I'm just stimulating it once, and then there's

202
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,012
some time frame before I stimulate it again.

203
00:20:57,614 --> 00:20:59,758
Once I stimulate it, it produces some force.

204
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:07,389
If I give it enough time and stimulate it again, when

205
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:10,975
it's fully relaxed, then it will produce the same force.

206
00:21:13,435 --> 00:21:17,319
And so notice this is the same strength of stimulation,

207
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:24,948
but if I just decrease the resting period before the next

208
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:29,192
stimulation, you can actually get them to some on top of each other.

209
00:21:32,836 --> 00:21:37,021
So the stimuli is the same strength of the stimulus,

210
00:21:37,021 --> 00:21:40,945
but the frequency at which I'm applying the stimulus is now increasing.

211
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:45,786
eventually you will reach something called tetanus.

212
00:21:47,668 --> 00:21:50,751
And that's where it doesn't matter if I increase the

213
00:21:50,751 --> 00:21:58,039
frequency even more, which is down over here compared to here, the force production is the same.

214
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:05,987
Any ideas as to why this is happening?

215
00:22:11,738 --> 00:22:14,001
Yeah, the cross bridges could be already formed.

216
00:22:15,863 --> 00:22:16,484
What else?

217
00:22:16,484 --> 00:22:17,325
That is a good one.

218
00:22:17,325 --> 00:22:18,006
Anything else?

219
00:22:18,006 --> 00:22:19,167
Which is kind of on to that.

220
00:22:22,051 --> 00:22:24,934
Well, so the motor units wouldn't necessarily be innervated

221
00:22:24,934 --> 00:22:27,958
because I'm just sending a signal down once, right?

222
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:33,004
Like I send one signal, it sends that signal down to the muscle fiber to contract.

223
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:36,651
Yeah, and I don't know if that's where you're going to,

224
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:40,476
but a lot of the time it's because it takes a little

225
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:45,823
bit of time for the sarcoplasmic reticulum to get all the calcium back out.

226
00:22:47,505 --> 00:22:50,389
But if you send a signal before all the calcium

227
00:22:50,389 --> 00:22:58,280
gets released from the troponin, well then that next signal is gonna be additive.

228
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,443
And so you'll have a little bit of calcium

229
00:23:01,402 --> 00:23:05,086
residue maybe or leftover from the first stimulus, and then

230
00:23:05,086 --> 00:23:07,869
you have another signal and it's gonna push out even more calcium.

231
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:12,394
So then they're gonna sum on top of each other and produce more force.

232
00:23:12,394 --> 00:23:14,996
So even though the strength of the stimulus was the same,

233
00:23:15,897 --> 00:23:21,684
if you don't let calcium kind of recover or fully recycle

234
00:23:21,684 --> 00:23:27,730
or get back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, then overall you'll have that build.

235
00:23:28,672 --> 00:23:31,497
But eventually, if you keep stimulating it as fast as

236
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:35,703
possible, well, there's just going to be all this calcium that you could possibly release.

237
00:23:35,703 --> 00:23:37,286
And that's when you get that tightness.

238
00:23:44,818 --> 00:23:45,640
Any questions here?

239
00:23:47,543 --> 00:23:47,743
All right.

240
00:23:52,786 --> 00:23:55,153
Okay, let's move on then to muscle soreness.

241
00:23:56,015 --> 00:23:58,944
Our last fun topic of muscles.

242
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:02,053
All right, what do we think about this one?

243
00:24:25,456 --> 00:24:28,444
Maybe I've influenced this, but you could also answer

244
00:24:28,444 --> 00:24:32,775
to what you think maybe the majority believe.

245
00:24:34,158 --> 00:24:38,048
What is the overall sentiment behind lactic acid and soreness?

246
00:25:03,593 --> 00:25:05,536
Okay, we'll close this down in about 10 seconds.

247
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:07,600
Anyone need more time?

248
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,423
Okay.

249
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:19,701
All right, three, two, one.

250
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:28,116
Okay, most people said false here, but,

251
00:25:29,547 --> 00:25:33,392
And I hope this is what you knew coming into this

252
00:25:33,392 --> 00:25:36,235
class and not me influencing it, but that's good.

253
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:42,783
So right now, it's possible out in the future we could find something new.

254
00:25:43,744 --> 00:25:47,528
But we don't have any evidence to support the claim

255
00:25:47,528 --> 00:25:53,175
that an increase in lactate production will cause muscle soreness.

256
00:25:58,167 --> 00:25:59,429
Any ideas?

257
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:04,439
And it's pretty much the same concepts that we talk about with a lot of these myths.

258
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:10,210
But any ideas as to what the problem might be with

259
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:17,144
this particular claim based on what you know about lactate

260
00:26:17,144 --> 00:26:20,530
production and then maybe even where soreness even occurs?

261
00:26:25,657 --> 00:26:30,044
Yeah, yeah, so one, if I took a lactate sample for

262
00:26:30,044 --> 00:26:33,228
everyone in here, we'd have a baseline lactate concentration.

263
00:26:34,691 --> 00:26:36,934
We don't get sore every day, but then one could

264
00:26:36,934 --> 00:26:40,479
argue, well, it's only during high intensity exercise.

265
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:45,968
Okay, well, during high intensity exercise, we get lactate to go everywhere.

266
00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:52,477
But it's interesting that we only get sore in one area.

267
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:54,921
Did someone have a question up there?

268
00:26:56,234 --> 00:27:02,011
And another piece, when you do a high intensity

269
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:07,647
exercise and you continuously do that same exercise, do you

270
00:27:07,647 --> 00:27:11,962
keep getting the same amount of soreness over and over and over again?

271
00:27:11,962 --> 00:27:16,349
No, I think most people realize, like, if you did a novel bout of exercise, like,

272
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:19,233
okay, I haven't done any resistance training for five years

273
00:27:19,233 --> 00:27:21,457
or something like that, and I go in there, and I'm just

274
00:27:21,457 --> 00:27:25,984
like, I'm gonna build all the muscle today during this workout, right?

275
00:27:25,984 --> 00:27:28,708
Like, this is the workout that's gonna make everything change.

276
00:27:28,708 --> 00:27:33,315
And you just kinda overdo it a little bit, and then you get really, really sore that day.

277
00:27:34,437 --> 00:27:40,075
But then if you continuously do that exercise, you're not gonna feel the same soreness.

278
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:46,423
So it's a little interesting that even if you start increasing the power output

279
00:27:46,423 --> 00:27:49,667
and you produce more lactate, you actually start getting less

280
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:54,713
and less and less sore, if not at all, with repeated exercise.

281
00:27:56,195 --> 00:27:59,379
OK, so then let's look into what is actually happening

282
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:04,986
with resistance training or any type of muscle damage and then muscle soreness.

283
00:28:06,502 --> 00:28:09,747
So muscle soreness in the exercise physiology community, we

284
00:28:09,747 --> 00:28:14,013
typically call it DOMS or delayed onset muscle soreness.

285
00:28:15,715 --> 00:28:21,183
It typically appears 24 to 48 hours after strenuous exercise.

286
00:28:21,183 --> 00:28:23,206
That's another interesting piece.

287
00:28:23,206 --> 00:28:27,312
We're producing the most amount of lactate during the exercise,

288
00:28:27,312 --> 00:28:32,239
but we feel the most sore after the lactate levels have all dissipated.

289
00:28:33,282 --> 00:28:38,771
So if I were to take a lactate sample before and after exercise and then four days later

290
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:43,800
or two days later, well, all of those non-exercising lactate

291
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,426
samples are gonna be much lower than when you are actually exercising.

292
00:28:49,369 --> 00:28:51,490
Okay, so what's actually causing this?

293
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:54,600
This is being caused because there are microscopic tears

294
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,147
in the muscle fibers or connective tissue.

295
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,455
Okay, well that makes sense.

296
00:28:59,455 --> 00:29:04,470
I'm physically disrupting the proteins for those muscle fibers.

297
00:29:06,863 --> 00:29:11,672
Try to remember that eccentric exercises can cause the most damage just

298
00:29:11,672 --> 00:29:16,081
because you usually can deal with higher forces or more

299
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:20,049
force or more weight when you're doing an eccentric exercise.

300
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:25,159
So eccentric exercises can cause more damage than a concentric exercise.

301
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,743
So what does this look like?

302
00:29:34,743 --> 00:29:38,668
So here we have some healthy sarcomeres here and then

303
00:29:38,668 --> 00:29:42,514
here we have some sarcomere damage in the center.

304
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:46,079
And this is happening hours to days after the resistance spout.

305
00:29:47,781 --> 00:29:53,309
Once you get that damage, the immune system responds to that damage.

306
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:57,394
And here we can see immune cell infiltration here.

307
00:29:58,516 --> 00:30:00,799
And this is also on the magnitude of days.

308
00:30:02,011 --> 00:30:08,261
And then after that, so days to weeks, we see some satellite cell activation.

309
00:30:09,323 --> 00:30:12,168
And that's gonna really help with the repair as well as

310
00:30:12,168 --> 00:30:18,438
the growth of those same fibers to deal with subsequent bouts of exercise.

311
00:30:21,243 --> 00:30:24,188
So we can categorize this muscle injury

312
00:30:25,805 --> 00:30:29,570
between these steps that are outlined in your textbook here.

313
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:33,155
First, you have some strenuous exercise, which is up here.

314
00:30:34,097 --> 00:30:36,660
Then you get some structural damage to those muscle fibers,

315
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:40,306
which leads to some sort of membrane damage.

316
00:30:41,828 --> 00:30:47,696
That damage typically includes the sarcoplasmic reticulum, so you see some calcium leaking out.

317
00:30:48,578 --> 00:30:54,546
You get protease activation, and that also results in breakdown of cellular proteins.

318
00:30:55,893 --> 00:31:00,944
What this is basically saying here is there's this

319
00:31:01,946 --> 00:31:08,400
pretty interesting response that once you see the cell damage in those muscle fibers,

320
00:31:10,388 --> 00:31:12,670
You get the immune system to go around and

321
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:18,837
start activating certain cells to undergo apoptosis, which is self-destruction of the cells.

322
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:22,080
So not only do you get the damage from the

323
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,207
resistance exercise, your immune system goes through and says, hey,

324
00:31:28,207 --> 00:31:30,329
you need a self-destruct, you need a self-destruct.

325
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:35,735
And so you get this kind of compounding impact of even further damage.

326
00:31:35,735 --> 00:31:39,720
This inflammatory response, I don't really like the positioning of this one,

327
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,885
this typically is happening throughout this first piece

328
00:31:42,885 --> 00:31:47,972
here, but you get an inflammatory response, you get some swelling and pain.

329
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:55,402
Eventually, the muscle fibers repair themselves using

330
00:31:55,402 --> 00:32:01,370
resident satellite cells, or myogenic precursor cells, just like what I depicted on the previous slide.

331
00:32:03,694 --> 00:32:04,054
Yes.

332
00:32:11,071 --> 00:32:20,441
Yeah, so I can't really speak on why that might

333
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:26,267
feel better because that might be personal preference, but if you can increase blood flow to the area

334
00:32:26,267 --> 00:32:29,911
and help clear out some of the pieces that are

335
00:32:29,911 --> 00:32:39,981
being damaged here, that potentially can make an individual feel a little bit better.

336
00:32:40,906 --> 00:32:53,542
Yeah, so it depends on what you're trying to achieve, but if I'm trying to increase blood flow,

337
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:56,566
right, that circulation, then that's always going to potentially

338
00:32:56,566 --> 00:32:59,490
improve the ability to clear out some of the waste products.

339
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:04,236
The one problem with this idea of waste products is

340
00:33:04,236 --> 00:33:07,420
people usually thought lactate was a waste product, but it's not.

341
00:33:08,851 --> 00:33:10,773
And we'll touch on to a few of those things.

342
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:13,957
I think a few of these slides might answer those questions as well.

343
00:33:13,957 --> 00:33:17,080
Yeah.

344
00:33:19,843 --> 00:33:23,327
Yes.

345
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:24,028
Yes, they are.

346
00:33:24,028 --> 00:33:25,670
And we'll get into that, too.

347
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,831
It's that repeated dot effect.

348
00:33:28,993 --> 00:33:30,435
So I'm sorry.

349
00:33:30,435 --> 00:33:31,776
I didn't hear you.

350
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:36,141
Is this like, is DOMs related to like injury, or is it related to like temperature?

351
00:33:37,032 --> 00:33:42,469
Well, so DOMS is the injury, and then eventually you get the hypertrophy.

352
00:33:45,672 --> 00:33:49,958
Okay, so what is a typical study designed to do this?

353
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:55,166
Because we can induce muscle damage quite easily, right?

354
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:59,973
We can have individuals perform some really tough eccentric

355
00:33:59,973 --> 00:34:05,260
tasks over and over and over again until we induce some type of muscle damage.

356
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:08,806
Don't worry about the study design in itself here.

357
00:34:08,806 --> 00:34:13,010
You would never be tested on this, but it's nice to see how

358
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:19,363
maybe complex some of these relatively simple ideas become when designing a study.

359
00:34:20,645 --> 00:34:24,413
But when we are getting some blood samples and

360
00:34:24,413 --> 00:34:27,779
you do pre-exercise, you do pre-exercise measurements and

361
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:35,977
then post-exercise measurements, and then you look at it maybe 24 to seven days post, let's look and see

362
00:34:35,977 --> 00:34:38,100
what we find from these results.

363
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,602
Okay, no surprise.

364
00:34:40,602 --> 00:34:48,412
Compared to baseline and before exercise, the soreness rating is significantly lower

365
00:34:48,412 --> 00:34:52,977
than after exercise, and it typically is the highest as far

366
00:34:52,977 --> 00:35:01,067
as how I feel sore 24 to 48 hours after the exercise bell.

367
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:02,288
If you are sore,

368
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:08,552
It's also, you probably noticed, your range of motion changes.

369
00:35:08,552 --> 00:35:13,458
So your range of motion is probably the highest before you exercise.

370
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:19,847
And then you probably can't extend too much before you

371
00:35:19,847 --> 00:35:22,791
kind of experience some sort of tension or pain.

372
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:24,714
And so your range of motion decreases.

373
00:35:24,714 --> 00:35:29,120
But as time goes on, you start to recover with that range of motion.

374
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,865
I think we've all kind of felt this in the past before.

375
00:35:42,211 --> 00:35:44,453
No, it's on a physical level.

376
00:35:44,453 --> 00:35:48,417
So if I do a bunch of curls and then I get

377
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:52,061
sore, it's going to be really hard to fully extend here.

378
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:56,045
So the range of motion will be this angle, this joint angle.

379
00:35:56,045 --> 00:35:56,265
Is that OK?

380
00:36:01,851 --> 00:36:01,971
Yeah.

381
00:36:01,971 --> 00:36:03,132
This isn't super related, but is this the same process as

382
00:36:03,132 --> 00:36:04,093
when you get a vaccine in the next day or more?

383
00:36:04,093 --> 00:36:05,094
Well, a little bit, yeah.

384
00:36:05,094 --> 00:36:12,552
So if you induce muscle damage in any way possible, those same steps occur, right?

385
00:36:12,552 --> 00:36:17,864
they'll need to clear those waste products from the acute damage in itself.

386
00:36:17,864 --> 00:36:23,096
And then eventually the immune system goes in and activates apoptosis around the area.

387
00:36:23,096 --> 00:36:26,123
And then yes, you do get a little sore from any muscle damage.

388
00:36:28,111 --> 00:36:32,458
Okay, limb circumference, no surprise here.

389
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:37,547
You get that swelling and edema, so the limb circumference gets a little bit bigger, right?

390
00:36:37,547 --> 00:36:39,550
We're not getting all swole because all of a

391
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:43,376
sudden you're building muscle fibers here immediately, right?

392
00:36:43,376 --> 00:36:46,221
It's more because you're getting that increase in blood flow.

393
00:36:48,175 --> 00:36:49,596
Okay, and then force production.

394
00:36:50,517 --> 00:36:55,241
This is the one piece where people kind of don't realize what's going on.

395
00:36:55,241 --> 00:36:57,183
It makes sense now that we're talking about it.

396
00:36:57,183 --> 00:37:01,367
If I straight destroyed a percentage of your muscle fibers,

397
00:37:01,367 --> 00:37:03,569
would you be able to generate the same amount of force?

398
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,132
No, and that is what we're seeing here.

399
00:37:07,132 --> 00:37:09,874
So we have force production here, the highest before

400
00:37:09,874 --> 00:37:13,618
that exercise, but after the exercise, you're getting a decrease

401
00:37:13,618 --> 00:37:16,140
in the force and slowly you're bringing this back up.

402
00:37:17,605 --> 00:37:21,381
The reason why this is so important is because we

403
00:37:21,381 --> 00:37:26,383
need to be careful about the subsequent exercise bouts we do after this.

404
00:37:27,308 --> 00:37:31,211
Because typically, if you have this muscle fiber damage and

405
00:37:31,211 --> 00:37:33,633
you're not able to generate the same amount of force and then

406
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:37,116
I apply the same amount of weight, you are now risking

407
00:37:37,116 --> 00:37:41,340
yourself or putting yourself at risk for injury, right?

408
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,262
Like if I can't sustain that exercise, maybe my form

409
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:48,106
changes because I'm trying to get that same amount of weight up.

410
00:37:48,106 --> 00:37:52,109
Or if I'm doing some type of repetitive task, the form

411
00:37:52,109 --> 00:37:56,873
kind of deteriorates and maybe I get some tendon damage or I get an overuse injury.

412
00:37:56,873 --> 00:37:59,501
So we need to be really careful with this piece

413
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:03,834
because if you are experiencing soreness, you are having a

414
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:09,853
loss in force production that could potentially put individuals at risk for injury.

415
00:38:11,993 --> 00:38:14,215
And the one thing you don't really wanna do if

416
00:38:14,215 --> 00:38:18,059
you're really going on a long-term training exercise bout, or

417
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:27,808
if you're an elite athlete, is you don't wanna go seven days with a decrease in exercise kind of intensity.

418
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:31,411
And it's fine to cycle on and off, but we need to be really careful about this.

419
00:38:32,392 --> 00:38:37,757
And so not always is soreness a good thing, right?

420
00:38:38,697 --> 00:38:41,460
And we can avoid this whole process.

421
00:38:42,993 --> 00:38:46,737
Okay, and the last piece here, this is nice, right?

422
00:38:47,637 --> 00:38:53,483
How do I actually know that the muscle fibers are being damaged?

423
00:38:55,445 --> 00:38:58,628
So this is plasma creatine kinase activity.

424
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:08,197
Baseline, pre-exercise, post-exercise, even 24 hours are still relatively low.

425
00:39:08,197 --> 00:39:09,658
And then we get this big spike.

426
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:13,043
So what is that telling me?

427
00:39:16,288 --> 00:39:18,571
First, we need to figure out what is creatine kinase?

428
00:39:18,571 --> 00:39:19,592
What is it?

429
00:39:19,592 --> 00:39:20,153
What does it do?

430
00:39:21,455 --> 00:39:22,316
And where do we find it?

431
00:39:25,961 --> 00:39:30,027
Help me out.

432
00:39:30,027 --> 00:39:32,430
Yeah, phosphorylates creatine, right?

433
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:39,139
Like it's basically allowing us to undergo that immediate energy pathway, the PCR ATP pathway.

434
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,328
Well, we store the majority of our creatine in our

435
00:39:43,328 --> 00:39:48,396
muscle fibers and we undergo this process in the muscle fibers.

436
00:39:49,378 --> 00:39:53,144
So then it would make sense that that enzyme is also in the muscle fibers.

437
00:39:54,045 --> 00:39:56,590
So if I take a blood sample and then all of a sudden

438
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:01,077
I see a spike in this enzyme, what is that telling me?

439
00:40:05,798 --> 00:40:08,783
It's usually in the muscle fibers, now it's not.

440
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:10,765
It's flowing kind of everywhere in the blood.

441
00:40:11,707 --> 00:40:12,869
What's the only way it can get out?

442
00:40:18,317 --> 00:40:21,702
Well, maybe not too much, but if the muscle, yeah.

443
00:40:21,702 --> 00:40:23,144
Yeah, muscles rupture, right?

444
00:40:23,144 --> 00:40:27,030
The membranes are rupturing and you're releasing all this creatine kinase out.

445
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:31,662
Creatine kinase isn't the only one.

446
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,345
Myoglobin is another one.

447
00:40:33,345 --> 00:40:36,231
You get these proteins that are only found in muscle fibers.

448
00:40:37,994 --> 00:40:40,398
And you might think like, ah, I don't care about this.

449
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:41,220
Well, maybe.

450
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:45,027
Most of you might go into future health care professions.

451
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:49,455
The first thing people do in the hospital, especially in

452
00:40:49,455 --> 00:40:52,461
the emergency room when they take a blood sample, is they run these.

453
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:58,136
If they see these levels high, that indicates muscle damage.

454
00:40:58,136 --> 00:41:00,139
Well yeah, that could be soreness, but what else could it be?

455
00:41:06,747 --> 00:41:07,929
Heart attack.

456
00:41:07,929 --> 00:41:11,793
If you have damage in the heart, you will have

457
00:41:11,793 --> 00:41:15,038
an increased level of myoglobin and creatine kinase.

458
00:41:15,038 --> 00:41:18,260
These are standard panels in the emergency room.

459
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:21,545
they will look at it and say, okay, this is going

460
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:25,670
to increase the probability that they may have had a heart attack.

461
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:31,258
They'll do some background, hey, been going to CrossFit lifting a ton of weights?

462
00:41:31,258 --> 00:41:32,620
No, okay.

463
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,504
Well, the only place they're gonna have this damage,

464
00:41:35,504 --> 00:41:38,629
especially if they've been having chest pain or anxiety or any

465
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:42,915
other problems, this is a good little sign that is telling

466
00:41:42,915 --> 00:41:47,541
us, okay, let's do some further testing because it's probable that they had a heart attack.

467
00:41:48,702 --> 00:41:53,192
So it's nice to kind of piece these things together, especially in future healthcare professions.

468
00:41:56,118 --> 00:42:02,131
Right, so we know these kind of are recurring inside of the muscle.

469
00:42:04,456 --> 00:42:08,480
Okay, so muscle excitation, contraction, and relaxation.

470
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,623
We already know about this piece.

471
00:42:10,623 --> 00:42:11,604
We've talked about it.

472
00:42:11,604 --> 00:42:12,565
This whole thing is here.

473
00:42:13,947 --> 00:42:16,971
This includes the motor end unit, the sarcolemma,

474
00:42:16,971 --> 00:42:23,419
and the sarcomeres themselves, sarcoplasmic reticulum with the calcium.

475
00:42:23,419 --> 00:42:25,982
What is causing this loss in strength?

476
00:42:27,384 --> 00:42:32,310
Well, it should make sense that something is being disrupted over here.

477
00:42:35,783 --> 00:42:38,005
but it's not all the same.

478
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:41,349
And so this figure does a really, really good job

479
00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:46,614
at looking into this kind of EC complex specifically.

480
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:51,720
Okay, so there is a strength loss immediately after

481
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:57,146
this high intensity bout that's causing some sort of muscle damage.

482
00:42:58,287 --> 00:43:05,014
The majority of the strength loss is coming from EC coupling failure.

483
00:43:06,749 --> 00:43:10,713
a relatively small proportion is coming from physical disruption.

484
00:43:13,336 --> 00:43:18,061
Then you get this increase in contractile protein loss.

485
00:43:20,444 --> 00:43:23,487
So if you remember, this is a little weird, right?

486
00:43:23,487 --> 00:43:26,170
We get a decrease in the physical disruption protein

487
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:31,896
loss, but an increase in the contractile protein three days after injury.

488
00:43:34,053 --> 00:43:38,217
The change between the physical disruption in doing the

489
00:43:38,217 --> 00:43:46,947
exercise and the contractile protein is the evidence of that apoptosis that we looked at.

490
00:43:46,947 --> 00:43:51,271
You have the physical disruption, and then a few days later, because of the immune response,

491
00:43:51,271 --> 00:43:53,254
your immune cells are just going in, and they're just

492
00:43:53,254 --> 00:43:55,836
like, nope, you're going away, you're going away, you're going away.

493
00:43:55,836 --> 00:44:03,925
And so you're getting this really large increase in contractile protein loss days afterwards.

494
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:08,897
the EC coupling failure is going to subside.

495
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:16,472
And then 14 to 28 days later, you're having that contractile protein loss.

496
00:44:16,472 --> 00:44:17,473
This makes sense to me, right?

497
00:44:17,473 --> 00:44:21,060
It's not immediate that you're gonna be able to recover and experience hypertrophy.

498
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,044
It's going to take a little bit of time.

499
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:30,504
The next question would be, will these pieces make sense, right?

500
00:44:30,504 --> 00:44:35,474
If I have physical disruption in the contractile proteins, that causes a loss in strength.

501
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:43,952
Where are we actually losing the ability to sustain a contraction from the EC coupling failure?

502
00:44:44,759 --> 00:44:48,484
Well, they tested multiple different sites, and it seems

503
00:44:48,484 --> 00:44:52,068
like the signal from the alpha motor neuron to

504
00:44:52,068 --> 00:44:56,113
the sarcolemma, right, acetylcholine binding onto those receptors, are OK.

505
00:44:56,113 --> 00:44:59,137
OK, that's not the place where the EC coupling failure is.

506
00:45:00,418 --> 00:45:05,164
Do the signals then propagate down the T-tubule, and they say yes, they're OK.

507
00:45:06,089 --> 00:45:13,520
What about the ability for, I guess, the thick and thin filaments or the cross-bridges to form?

508
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,485
It looks like that's okay.

509
00:45:16,485 --> 00:45:21,032
Where they're not sure, they're thinking it's between the

510
00:45:21,032 --> 00:45:24,938
signal that gets to the T-tubule for some reason is not

511
00:45:24,938 --> 00:45:28,443
able to send that signal to the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

512
00:45:28,443 --> 00:45:32,583
Everything's functioning okay, but for some reason,

513
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:37,388
it appears that the signal transmission from T-tubule

514
00:45:37,388 --> 00:45:42,172
to sarcoplasmic reticulum is not really getting across.

515
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:44,775
And so therefore, the calcium is not being released.

516
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:54,184
So this is where we believe the mechanism or the actual

517
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:57,247
failure site is when we're dealing with EC coupling failure.

518
00:46:01,772 --> 00:46:02,252
Pretty cool.

519
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:09,189
Okay, so now you're sore, you dealt with that pain,

520
00:46:10,531 --> 00:46:14,138
and then eventually you're gonna go back and do the same exercise bow.

521
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,748
We call the ability to do the same exercise bow and

522
00:46:19,748 --> 00:46:24,055
not experience the same amount of soreness as the repeated bowed effect.

523
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:28,440
So it's a bout of unfamiliar exercise that results

524
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:34,448
in the delayed onset muscle soreness, but following recovery, another

525
00:46:34,448 --> 00:46:38,494
bout of the same exercise results in minimal injury.

526
00:46:41,037 --> 00:46:43,981
So you have that initial bout of exercise, you get the muscle damage,

527
00:46:43,981 --> 00:46:46,705
and then you get some adaptations that are multiple theories

528
00:46:46,705 --> 00:46:51,932
here, and then this repeated bout of exercise is going to cause less muscle damage.

529
00:46:57,852 --> 00:47:05,221
So then just like what I was mentioning before, to me, if I wanna avoid all the strength loss,

530
00:47:05,221 --> 00:47:09,606
avoid the structural protein damage that lasts up to 21

531
00:47:09,606 --> 00:47:15,093
plus days, that's a really long time, right, to be dealing with the strength loss.

532
00:47:16,294 --> 00:47:20,960
If my overall goal is to continue to progress in,

533
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,323
if I'm doing a resistance training program, strength gains.

534
00:47:25,405 --> 00:47:25,986
So then,

535
00:47:27,232 --> 00:47:30,376
The recommendation is that you should slowly begin a

536
00:47:30,376 --> 00:47:36,342
specific exercise over five to 10 training sessions to avoid delayed onset muscle soreness.

537
00:47:38,465 --> 00:47:46,994
So we wanna do submaximal kind of eccentric exercises over kind of multiple days

538
00:47:46,994 --> 00:47:49,857
and not try to go to the extreme and build your way

539
00:47:49,857 --> 00:47:53,982
or ease your way into it before you start adding on a ton of weight.

540
00:47:56,527 --> 00:47:57,909
or whatever program it is, right?

541
00:47:57,909 --> 00:48:00,172
You don't want to just go off and start doing downhill

542
00:48:00,172 --> 00:48:03,918
running right off the bat if you're not an experienced runner.

543
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:08,184
Because downhill running is primarily eccentric.

544
00:48:08,184 --> 00:48:12,170
That's why I mentioned that.

545
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:15,555
OK, some of you are like, no, no pain, no gain.

546
00:48:17,618 --> 00:48:18,619
True or false?

547
00:48:57,513 --> 00:48:59,375
Okay, let's go 20 more seconds on this one.

548
00:49:05,483 --> 00:49:06,744
Double check you have something in.

549
00:49:06,744 --> 00:49:09,608
10 seconds here.

550
00:49:09,608 --> 00:49:14,794
I think we're missing four clickers, three clickers.

551
00:49:17,697 --> 00:49:22,163
All right, I'll close this down in three, two, one.

552
00:49:25,827 --> 00:49:27,469
I'm just curious what people said,

553
00:49:32,731 --> 00:49:36,678
OK, so some people are like, all right, yeah, no pain, no gain.

554
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,303
You have to feel the burn.

555
00:49:39,303 --> 00:49:40,405
You have to feel the pain.

556
00:49:40,405 --> 00:49:41,347
And you need the soreness.

557
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:44,192
Well, we need to be careful.

558
00:49:44,192 --> 00:49:46,857
Because if you overdo it, does anyone know the

559
00:49:46,857 --> 00:49:50,183
risks, especially with muscle damage, what the risks are here?

560
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:54,790
Yeah, it's pretty bad, right?

561
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:57,453
You can get something called rhabdomyolysis.

562
00:49:57,453 --> 00:50:00,917
And this occurs when there is excessive muscle tissue damage.

563
00:50:01,918 --> 00:50:06,704
And with that damage, you are releasing a lot of

564
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:12,631
things that should not be released into your blood at a fast rate, right?

565
00:50:12,631 --> 00:50:15,194
Like creatine kinase, myoglobin, all those things we talked

566
00:50:15,194 --> 00:50:21,081
about, and actin, myosin, all of those things we don't really want inside of the blood.

567
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:28,515
If you do that, the initial muscle damage bout then

568
00:50:28,515 --> 00:50:36,486
starts to activate the immune system and then you get an even larger response, right?

569
00:50:36,486 --> 00:50:39,330
And so this can really exponentially become a problem

570
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:42,775
very quickly because your body doesn't really know what's going on.

571
00:50:42,775 --> 00:50:45,139
It's trying to clear all these problems and then all

572
00:50:45,139 --> 00:50:47,883
of a sudden it's going in there inducing apoptosis.

573
00:50:47,883 --> 00:50:51,388
And so the kind of

574
00:50:52,499 --> 00:50:57,390
The problem is now you're forcing the kidneys to deal

575
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:04,326
with all of this excess protein and electrolyte kind of dispersion

576
00:51:04,326 --> 00:51:09,698
into the blood and it causes a lot of problems in the kidneys.

577
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:16,258
If you have rhabdomyolysis, especially in a severe kind

578
00:51:16,258 --> 00:51:21,585
of condition, you will find those red blood cells in your blood.

579
00:51:21,585 --> 00:51:27,774
You are overworking your kidneys, and your kidneys have a really hard time dealing with it.

580
00:51:27,774 --> 00:51:30,037
So you definitely don't want this.

581
00:51:30,037 --> 00:51:31,879
If you're seeing this type of color in your

582
00:51:31,879 --> 00:51:35,003
urine, that's probably an indication you should probably seek

583
00:51:35,003 --> 00:51:38,328
some medical attention as quickly as possible.

584
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:41,372
So what's the story here?

585
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:44,027
Moderation is key, right?

586
00:51:44,027 --> 00:51:45,390
Like, we need to be really careful.

587
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:48,454
It's this whole idea, like, too little?

588
00:51:48,454 --> 00:51:49,976
No, that's probably not good.

589
00:51:49,976 --> 00:51:51,198
Too much?

590
00:51:51,198 --> 00:51:53,221
Yes, that's also a really big problem, right?

591
00:51:53,221 --> 00:52:01,053
There's always something in the middle where we're achieving probably the most optimal results.

592
00:52:01,053 --> 00:52:07,463
Okay, so the next time you're in the gym, you can think of this figure here.

593
00:52:07,463 --> 00:52:10,347
Okay, any questions on

594
00:52:11,491 --> 00:52:17,179
Muscle soreness, damage, repeated bout effect.

595
00:52:20,144 --> 00:52:20,244
Okay.

596
00:52:28,816 --> 00:52:36,047
If not, then we will move on to chapter nine, circulatory response to exercise.

597
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:40,783
So up to this point, we've kind of outlined a few things.

598
00:52:42,064 --> 00:52:43,786
We've talked about work and power.

599
00:52:44,667 --> 00:52:47,509
We talked about energy production and how important it is

600
00:52:47,509 --> 00:52:51,993
to get oxygen from the outside into our body and then what

601
00:52:51,993 --> 00:52:59,681
happens at our cells as far as how we're generating oxygen or ATP with and without oxygen.

602
00:53:01,062 --> 00:53:06,622
But now we need to think about, well, how do we get the blood from our heart

603
00:53:06,622 --> 00:53:07,471
to our muscles.

604
00:53:08,663 --> 00:53:10,725
So this is the circulatory system.

605
00:53:11,802 --> 00:53:13,264
and the response to exercise.

606
00:53:14,225 --> 00:53:17,790
The body has to deliver more blood to those tissues.

607
00:53:18,952 --> 00:53:23,899
So we're going to talk about an overall organization of the circulatory system,

608
00:53:23,899 --> 00:53:27,343
hemodynamics, which is basically how blood is kind

609
00:53:27,343 --> 00:53:33,071
of moving around, cardiac cycle, cardiac output, changes in

610
00:53:33,071 --> 00:53:39,460
oxygen delivery to muscle during exercise, the circulatory responses to exercise,

611
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:43,206
And then the regulation of cardiovascular adjustments to exercise.

612
00:53:44,248 --> 00:53:48,254
So these are kind of the topics we're going to touch on chapter nine.

613
00:53:50,959 --> 00:53:53,002
OK, so we're going to start easy here.

614
00:53:53,002 --> 00:53:54,925
Organization of the circulatory system.

615
00:53:55,967 --> 00:54:01,550
Well, the circulatory system works very closely with the pulmonary system.

616
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:03,512
which is pretty much your lungs, right?

617
00:54:03,512 --> 00:54:06,075
The lungs have to bring the oxygen in from the outside

618
00:54:06,075 --> 00:54:12,362
and then deliver it to basically the heart so then the heart can pump it to the rest of the body.

619
00:54:13,543 --> 00:54:18,709
So the purpose of the cardio respiratory system, so the heart and the lungs,

620
00:54:18,709 --> 00:54:23,134
would be to transport oxygen nutrients to the tissues and

621
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:26,798
then remove CO2 and waste products from the tissues.

622
00:54:28,482 --> 00:54:32,426
What we often forget about the circulatory system is

623
00:54:32,426 --> 00:54:38,713
it's also extremely important in the regulation of core body temperature.

624
00:54:40,255 --> 00:54:44,599
The movement of blood and the dissipation in different regions

625
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:50,325
of the body can really only happen if the circulatory system

626
00:54:50,325 --> 00:54:52,828
is working together to send the blood to different areas.

627
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:56,532
So you can think of it as like

628
00:54:58,385 --> 00:55:01,828
cooling system or air conditioner inside of the body.

629
00:55:01,828 --> 00:55:06,513
It needs to redirect some of that warmer blood flow so it can dissipate it to the skin.

630
00:55:09,256 --> 00:55:12,740
There are two major adjustments of blood flow during exercise.

631
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:16,463
We have one, an increase in cardiac output, and

632
00:55:16,463 --> 00:55:21,488
two, the redistribution of blood flow from inactive to active muscles

633
00:55:21,488 --> 00:55:26,113
or to the skin, which is this bottom piece here, thermoregulation.

634
00:55:34,278 --> 00:55:35,901
OK, here's the structure of the heart.

635
00:55:37,203 --> 00:55:41,049
You definitely don't need to memorize all these structures.

636
00:55:41,049 --> 00:55:44,635
It's nice to know that we have ventricles and atriums.

637
00:55:44,635 --> 00:55:48,120
And separating those, we have valves.

638
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:52,728
I highlight these four here, only because sometimes you'll hear

639
00:55:52,728 --> 00:55:54,611
us talk about the names of these valves.

640
00:55:54,611 --> 00:55:56,654
And so you can go back and reference

641
00:55:56,654 --> 00:55:58,217
where they actually are.

642
00:55:58,217 --> 00:56:02,244
So if I say the aortic semilunar valve, you know

643
00:56:02,244 --> 00:56:15,126
if it's referencing this valve here that is pretty much the opening from that ventricle to the aorta.

644
00:56:15,126 --> 00:56:15,186
OK.

645
00:56:16,482 --> 00:56:19,507
So we have the pulmonary circuit, which is the right side of the heart.

646
00:56:19,507 --> 00:56:22,732
It pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs via the

647
00:56:22,732 --> 00:56:27,680
pulmonary arteries, returns oxygenated blood to the left side of the heart via pulmonary veins.

648
00:56:29,543 --> 00:56:32,348
It's basically this piece right here, pulmonary circuit.

649
00:56:33,627 --> 00:56:36,853
Then we have the systemic circuit, or kind of the rest of the body.

650
00:56:36,853 --> 00:56:39,497
This is the left side of the heart, and that's going

651
00:56:39,497 --> 00:56:42,963
to pump oxygenated blood to the whole body via the

652
00:56:42,963 --> 00:56:49,053
arteries and returns deoxygenated blood to the right side of the heart via veins.

653
00:56:49,053 --> 00:56:49,955
So that's this, right?

654
00:56:49,955 --> 00:56:55,244
Pumping oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body so we can deliver that oxygen.

655
00:56:55,244 --> 00:57:00,177
And then the veins are going to return the deoxygenated blood to the right side of the heart.

656
00:57:00,177 --> 00:57:03,585
So then you can then pump that blood to the lungs and repeat the process.

657
00:57:06,212 --> 00:57:08,899
Hopefully we're all already familiar with this.

658
00:57:10,735 --> 00:57:13,779
OK, so we'll move on to hemodynamics.

659
00:57:13,779 --> 00:57:18,204
But before we can look at hemodynamics, we need to understand the components of blood.

660
00:57:19,545 --> 00:57:24,271
So the physical characteristics of blood are easily distinguished

661
00:57:24,271 --> 00:57:26,533
when we can centrifuge a blood sample.

662
00:57:27,455 --> 00:57:30,138
If we were to take a blood sample and then centrifuge

663
00:57:30,138 --> 00:57:33,021
it, you will see some separation in the blood.

664
00:57:33,021 --> 00:57:38,360
The majority of your blood is kind of this

665
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,427
fluid that's free of any cells, and that's the plasma here.

666
00:57:44,971 --> 00:57:48,337
You then get this white buffy coat that contains platelets,

667
00:57:48,337 --> 00:57:50,981
white blood cells, some kind of immune cells.

668
00:57:52,023 --> 00:57:58,534
And then down here, you get this red cell volume where it contains packed red blood cells.

669
00:57:58,534 --> 00:58:01,279
And inside those red blood cells, we have the hemoglobin molecules.

670
00:58:02,744 --> 00:58:05,488
In order to get hematocrit, we typically do the height of

671
00:58:05,488 --> 00:58:09,233
the red blood cells divided by the total height here to get a fraction.

672
00:58:12,998 --> 00:58:15,742
So again, plasma's liquid portion of the blood contains

673
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:28,699
ions, proteins, hormones, cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

674
00:58:28,699 --> 00:58:31,921
Okay, so why do we care about hematocrit?

675
00:58:31,921 --> 00:58:37,472
Hematocrit is a percentage of blood that is composed of packed red blood cells.

676
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:43,064
The average hematocrit for college age males is 42% and females is 38.

677
00:58:43,064 --> 00:58:46,150
It's nice to know

678
00:58:47,716 --> 00:58:51,321
because if we have a decrease in plasma volume or

679
00:58:51,321 --> 00:58:54,485
an increase in red cell volume, the hematocrit could increase,

680
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:58,110
and that would change the viscosity of blood.

681
00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:01,114
If you change the viscosity of blood, that's gonna change

682
00:59:01,114 --> 00:59:05,900
flow, and we'll talk about that a little bit later.

683
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:14,652
It's also good, just like I mentioned, that hematocrit is highly dependent on fluid status.

684
00:59:16,589 --> 00:59:25,560
you can have an individual who is anemic, where their hematocrit is lower than normal.

685
00:59:27,362 --> 00:59:29,945
And so we would say in this instance, this individual

686
00:59:31,186 --> 00:59:36,893
maybe needs iron or something else to help red blood cell production.

687
00:59:39,536 --> 00:59:44,622
But you could imagine that I could probably get to this same point

688
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:51,509
and then decrease plasma volume here, so maybe dehydration,

689
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:55,235
and still get a hematocrit value that looks normal.

690
00:59:57,379 --> 01:00:00,224
So we need to just be really careful because just because

691
01:00:00,224 --> 01:00:04,531
you have a high or a low hematocrit for one particular blood

692
01:00:04,531 --> 01:00:07,757
sample does not mean we know for sure what's going on.

693
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:15,510
Because polycythemia here, we have hematocrit over 70%, and dehydration is 70%.

694
01:00:16,672 --> 01:00:22,262
So I don't know whether this increase in hematocrit is due

695
01:00:22,262 --> 01:00:25,948
to a loss in plasma volume or an increase in red blood cell production.

696
01:00:29,962 --> 01:00:33,567
And that's why they always recommend, along with fasting, but

697
01:00:33,567 --> 01:00:38,994
just, hey, when you come in and do this blood draw, make sure you're hydrated normally.

698
01:00:38,994 --> 01:00:40,816
You're not over hydrating or under hydrating.

699
01:00:40,816 --> 01:00:46,723
You're just normal, and you come in for this blood draw with the best normal baseline possible.

700
01:00:49,767 --> 01:00:52,571
Because you can imagine someone coming in who actually

701
01:00:52,571 --> 01:00:56,516
is anemic, but they're dehydrated, and then now the physician's like, no, you're good.

702
01:00:56,516 --> 01:00:59,273
Everything's normal here.

703
01:00:59,273 --> 01:01:01,015
And you just need to be careful with that.

704
01:01:01,015 --> 01:01:01,796
OK, blood flow.

705
01:01:03,778 --> 01:01:09,065
Blood flow is directly proportional to the pressure difference between the two ends of the system.

706
01:01:10,747 --> 01:01:14,711
The only way inside of the body you can get blood to move

707
01:01:14,711 --> 01:01:20,438
from point A to point B is if you move the blood from high pressure to low pressure.

708
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:25,545
the way you create that pressure is the heart contracts,

709
01:01:25,545 --> 01:01:27,948
and now you have an increase in pressure right at the

710
01:01:27,948 --> 01:01:31,153
aorta, and a decrease in pressure wherever the blood is going.

711
01:01:32,675 --> 01:01:35,379
So that is this change in pressure.

712
01:01:37,742 --> 01:01:41,887
It is inversely proportional to the resistance, meaning as

713
01:01:41,887 --> 01:01:47,455
resistance goes down, we have an increase in blood flow.

714
01:01:51,738 --> 01:01:55,745
If you remember, resistance is a pretty complicated, it's not

715
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:58,770
that complicated, but it has a lot of other pieces to it.

716
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:01,654
There's a constant, you multiply it by length, divide it

717
01:02:01,654 --> 01:02:07,083
by, or multiply it by the viscosity and then you divide it by the radius to the fourth power.

718
01:02:08,426 --> 01:02:18,302
So if it's radius to the fourth power, the major factor that is influencing resistance is radius.

719
01:02:19,666 --> 01:02:25,753
So vasoconstriction, vasodilation is going to be a big piece for this resistance.

720
01:02:28,256 --> 01:02:30,719
So yes, length does matter.

721
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:32,060
Viscosity does matter.

722
01:02:33,142 --> 01:02:36,385
But resistance, small changes to resistance is gonna have

723
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:47,058
large impacts to, sorry, small changes in radius is gonna have a large change in resistance.

724
01:02:47,058 --> 01:02:48,880
Because it's radius to the fourth power.

725
01:02:54,074 --> 01:02:55,395
Okay, pressure.

726
01:02:55,395 --> 01:02:57,497
Just like I mentioned, just a change in pressure.

727
01:02:57,497 --> 01:03:01,641
We have low pressure in the veins and high pressure in the arteries.

728
01:03:03,823 --> 01:03:10,610
Because of that, it's very easy to move blood from the arteries to the veins.

729
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:15,574
It then becomes a little bit of a problem to move blood from the veins back to the heart,

730
01:03:15,574 --> 01:03:19,498
but we'll touch on some cool characteristics or some strategies

731
01:03:19,498 --> 01:03:22,461
the body kind of undertakes to get that blood back to the heart.

732
01:03:28,178 --> 01:03:29,861
Okay, the cardiac cycle.

733
01:03:29,861 --> 01:03:31,444
We have two major cycles.

734
01:03:32,626 --> 01:03:36,713
We have diastole, which is the relaxation period, and

735
01:03:36,713 --> 01:03:41,261
then we have systole, which is the contraction period, or the contraction phase.

736
01:03:43,064 --> 01:03:50,457
So diastole, or the relaxation period, is when pressure in the ventricles is low.

737
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:58,261
The pressure's low in the ventricles when the ventricles are relaxing or the heart is relaxing.

738
01:04:00,585 --> 01:04:03,709
Because the pressure is low in the ventricles and blood

739
01:04:03,709 --> 01:04:11,601
is kinda coming back in to the atrium, they are filling the ventricles.

740
01:04:12,661 --> 01:04:16,228
So you get blood filling from the atria, the mitral

741
01:04:16,228 --> 01:04:22,340
and the tricuspid valves open when ventricle pressure is lower than atrial pressure.

742
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:24,564
So that's what these P's are indicating, pressure here.

743
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:35,445
Okay, during contraction, so the heart contracts, pressure in the ventricles rise.

744
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:39,760
But the blood doesn't leave just because the pressure rises.

745
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:44,667
It has to overcome or open the aortic and pulmonary valves.

746
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:50,416
That only happens, again, when ventricular pressure is greater than aortic pressure.

747
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:57,687
Once those valves open, blood leaves and it goes to the pulmonary and systemic circuit.

748
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:07,817
Okay, if we can combine these two, the cardiac cycle with

749
01:05:07,817 --> 01:05:13,367
these two phases, we know that at rest, diastole is longer than systole.

750
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:19,738
It's about kind of one third to two thirds, meaning we

751
01:05:19,738 --> 01:05:27,792
spend about 66% of the time in diastole, one third of the time in systole at rest.

752
01:05:29,662 --> 01:05:33,549
As soon as we start exercising, we get the heart to beat faster.

753
01:05:35,032 --> 01:05:40,322
Both systole and diastole are shorter, but we typically spend

754
01:05:40,322 --> 01:05:43,287
a little bit more time in systole than diastole.

755
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:49,459
But it's closer to a 50-50 as opposed to a 33-66.

756
01:06:00,678 --> 01:06:02,222
OK, any questions here?

757
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:07,135
So this will come into play, especially in lab, when

758
01:06:07,135 --> 01:06:10,183
you start doing the formulas to calculate mean RTL pressure.

759
01:06:10,985 --> 01:06:12,409
So you'll see like 1 third.

760
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:16,560
If you ever wonder where that 1 third comes from, well, that's this.

761
01:06:20,152 --> 01:06:23,920
Okay, so the relationship among pressure and volume during

762
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:28,850
the cardiac cycle can be represented pretty well from this

763
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:33,078
kind of pressure-volume loop in the Wiger's diagram, which we'll go over.

764
01:06:35,924 --> 01:06:38,970
In this instance, if we have the mitral valve closing,

765
01:06:40,638 --> 01:06:45,525
You now have an increase in pressure from the left ventricle.

766
01:06:45,525 --> 01:06:49,051
So we're just looking at left ventricular pressure here.

767
01:06:49,051 --> 01:06:54,179
The pressure goes up, but no volume is changing inside

768
01:06:54,179 --> 01:06:57,664
of the ventricle until the valve opens, which is at this point.

769
01:06:58,866 --> 01:07:01,124
Pressure continues to go up.

770
01:07:01,124 --> 01:07:04,992
But then the pressure from the outside is exceeding the inside.

771
01:07:04,992 --> 01:07:07,157
So then the semilunar valve closes.

772
01:07:07,157 --> 01:07:09,201
So the aortic valve closes.

773
01:07:09,201 --> 01:07:12,829
The pressure decreases because now you're in relaxation.

774
01:07:14,232 --> 01:07:15,936
Kind of the ventricle relaxes.

775
01:07:15,936 --> 01:07:18,501
The mitral valve then opens.

776
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:19,704
And then we move on through here.

777
01:07:19,704 --> 01:07:21,748
And you can see the volume changes here.

778
01:07:22,893 --> 01:07:26,420
When we have the most amount of volume in the ventricles,

779
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:30,427
we call that, at least in this frame here, N-diastolic volume.

780
01:07:31,509 --> 01:07:37,320
After systole, so after contraction, we have the N-systolic volume.

781
01:07:40,005 --> 01:07:44,513
And that makes sense that after contraction, there's less volume inside of the ventricles.

782
01:07:47,058 --> 01:07:49,702
This is another artist rendering.

783
01:07:49,702 --> 01:07:53,647
If this doesn't kind of sit well with you, don't worry.

784
01:07:54,589 --> 01:07:57,653
There are many other different figures that you can look at here.

785
01:07:57,653 --> 01:08:01,459
But here, we're filling up the ventricle, so that's the end diastolic volume.

786
01:08:01,459 --> 01:08:02,841
You undergo contraction.

787
01:08:03,722 --> 01:08:07,087
And now, inside the ventricle, there's less blood.

788
01:08:07,087 --> 01:08:08,349
Where did all that blood go?

789
01:08:08,349 --> 01:08:11,313
Well, that goes out into the blood vessels, and we

790
01:08:11,313 --> 01:08:14,938
call that volume that left the heart stroke volume.

791
01:08:16,994 --> 01:08:20,881
So N-diastolic minus N-systolic gives me stroke volume here.

792
01:08:30,177 --> 01:08:30,979
Wigger's diagram.

793
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:36,408
I believe you all have already seen this and memorized

794
01:08:36,408 --> 01:08:39,053
this and done a really great job in physiology.

795
01:08:40,737 --> 01:08:44,904
we are not gonna use the Wiger's diagram here in XFIS.

796
01:08:44,904 --> 01:08:47,408
We're still gonna deal with this concept, but we're

797
01:08:47,408 --> 01:08:49,852
not gonna, don't worry about the Wiger's diagram.

798
01:08:49,852 --> 01:08:54,059
We're actually gonna use something called the left ventricular pressure volume loop.

799
01:08:55,241 --> 01:08:58,627
And this tracks the same way as the Wiger's diagram.

800
01:08:58,627 --> 01:09:02,173
It puts the pressure and the volume into one graph.

801
01:09:02,173 --> 01:09:04,737
And so it makes it a lot easier to deal with.

802
01:09:06,539 --> 01:09:10,266
The key thing that you want to remember about the pressure

803
01:09:10,266 --> 01:09:15,255
volume loop is you are moving kind of right to left.

804
01:09:15,255 --> 01:09:16,998
So I'll restart this here.

805
01:09:16,998 --> 01:09:19,482
So even though you're going left to right over here, this

806
01:09:19,482 --> 01:09:26,615
is going up, up, left, left, down, down, down, and then to the right.

807
01:09:26,615 --> 01:09:29,560
So this is the direction of the pressure volume loop.

808
01:09:31,126 --> 01:09:33,069
right, this counterclockwise movement.

809
01:09:33,069 --> 01:09:37,875
So I would draw arrows making sure you know the direction of everything here.

810
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:43,502
On the X axis we have left ventricular volume.

811
01:09:43,502 --> 01:09:46,967
On the Y axis you have left ventricular pressure.

812
01:09:46,967 --> 01:09:48,349
So volume over pressure.

813
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:53,556
So I'll play that one more time just so you know, just

814
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:56,880
because it is a point of confusion as far as direction.

815
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:10,120
OK.

816
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:14,007
I think this might be a decent place to stop here.

817
01:10:14,007 --> 01:10:18,656
We'll start with kind of filling this box in on Thursday.

818
01:10:18,656 --> 01:10:20,760
Enjoy the rest of your day.

819
01:10:21,582 --> 01:10:23,425
Let me know if you have any questions.
