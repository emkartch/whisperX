1
00:00:05,144 --> 00:00:06,285
Afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:08,648
Hope you're good.

3
00:00:08,648 --> 00:00:11,872
It's really a pleasure to welcome you here for

4
00:00:12,873 --> 00:00:19,540
the University of Colorado Boulder's eighth annual three-minute thesis final competition.

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,664
I'm Scott Adler, Dean of the Graduate School.

6
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:27,830
Thrilled to have you join us for really one of my favorite events of the year.

7
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:33,396
And it's really nice to pull everyone together these days for something fun and positive.

8
00:00:34,574 --> 00:00:37,198
The Graduate School at CU Boulder is home to

9
00:00:37,198 --> 00:00:41,644
nearly 6,000 graduate students across 130 different programs.

10
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:47,172
And these students are engaged in groundbreaking research, creative work,

11
00:00:49,155 --> 00:00:51,679
and creative work training to become the next

12
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,377
generation of scholars, artists, teachers, and researchers.

13
00:00:56,377 --> 00:00:58,999
from astrophysics to dance.

14
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:02,082
They're pushing the boundaries of their disciplines and

15
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:07,187
tackling some of the most complex challenges of our time.

16
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:14,213
Our students' important work is made possible in part by

17
00:01:14,213 --> 00:01:17,937
the generous support of our donors who fund the fellowships

18
00:01:18,757 --> 00:01:22,661
and grants awarded by the graduate school each year.

19
00:01:22,661 --> 00:01:26,566
So if you saw the slideshow earlier,

20
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:31,894
You caught a glimpse of some of the outstanding scholarship going on by our graduate students.

21
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:38,623
Their achievements really do reflect the excellence of the

22
00:01:38,623 --> 00:01:41,608
graduate school and the students that we have here.

23
00:01:41,608 --> 00:01:45,153
And we're deeply grateful to our donors for their

24
00:01:45,153 --> 00:01:49,179
commitment to advancing research and innovation at CU Boulder.

25
00:01:51,382 --> 00:01:55,270
And yet, much of the remarkable research

26
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:00,941
that our students are doing remains known only to specialists within their given field.

27
00:02:02,324 --> 00:02:06,252
And that's why we do the 3MT competition and why it's so special.

28
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:13,466
It's more than a showcase of research, it's a testament to the power of effective communication.

29
00:02:14,788 --> 00:02:16,381
Today our finalists

30
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:19,605
will take on the challenge of distilling complex

31
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:26,674
ideas into compelling, accessible narratives that engage, inform, and inspire us all.

32
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:34,304
Now this 3MT journey began last fall when 31 graduate

33
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:38,330
students embarked on a series of workshops designed to

34
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:42,996
hone their storytelling, writing, and presentation skills, even

35
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,320
including a session on improv comedy techniques.

36
00:02:47,482 --> 00:02:51,128
And after months of hard work and making it past

37
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:56,777
the preliminary round of the competition, we now have 10 exceptional finalists.

38
00:02:57,898 --> 00:02:59,902
Your program says 11, one got sick.

39
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:08,255
And these finalists are ready to present their research in just three minutes.

40
00:03:09,877 --> 00:03:15,562
So to our participants, congratulations on making it this far.

41
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:19,848
Your dedication, creativity, public speaking, and communication skills

42
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:24,636
are already a testament to your excellence.

43
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:33,088
To our esteemed judges, thank you for your time and expertise in evaluating these presentations.

44
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,196
And to our audience, students, faculty, staff, family,

45
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:43,003
friends, and community members, your support is what makes this event so special.

46
00:03:43,827 --> 00:03:47,794
So let's celebrate the power of knowledge, the courage

47
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,058
of discovery and the joy of learning together.

48
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:57,310
Without further ado, let's begin the 2025 three minute thesis final competition.

49
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:04,823
So it's my pleasure to introduce our emcee for today.

50
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,667
My dear friend, Bud Coleman, Professor Emeritus and the

51
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:15,575
inaugural holder of the Roe Green Endowed Chair in Theater

52
00:04:15,575 --> 00:04:19,100
and former chair of the Department of Theater and Dance and

53
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,128
former Associate Dean of Faculty Affairs in the College of Arts and Sciences, Bud Coleman.

54
00:04:30,655 --> 00:04:34,039
We are thrilled to have you here in support of our

55
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:41,768
graduate students as they rise to the challenge of presenting their research in just three minutes.

56
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:44,672
Your presence, both here in person and via the

57
00:04:44,672 --> 00:04:52,361
live stream, demonstrates incredible support for CU's Boulder community of scholars.

58
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:53,504
The three minute

59
00:04:53,504 --> 00:04:58,090
Competition, or known as 3MT, started at the University of

60
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,676
Queensland in 2008 and has since grown into an international

61
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:08,624
phenomenon hosted by over 900 universities in 85 countries.

62
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:15,073
3MT cultivates students' research communication skills, pushing them

63
00:05:15,073 --> 00:05:21,128
to distill complex ideas into compelling narratives for a general audience.

64
00:05:21,128 --> 00:05:27,530
To put this challenge into perspective, the average dissertation is around 80,000 words.

65
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:34,578
It would take approximately 9 to 12 hours to read it.

66
00:05:34,578 --> 00:05:42,189
These students have distilled very complex ideas into three minutes.

67
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:43,611
No pressure, right?

68
00:05:45,835 --> 00:05:49,460
As Scott mentioned, this year marks the eighth year that

69
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,226
CU Boulder has participated in 3MT, and today's winners

70
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:58,253
not only receive recognition, but also cash awards.

71
00:05:58,253 --> 00:06:02,937
First place receives $1,500 and will go on to represent

72
00:06:02,937 --> 00:06:07,421
CU Boulder at the Western Association of Graduate Schools competition,

73
00:06:07,421 --> 00:06:09,303
which will be held in March of this year.

74
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:15,108
The runner-up will take home $750, and the People's

75
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:20,253
Choice Award winner, chosen by you, will receive $500.

76
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:26,249
Now, the competition's rules for today's presentations are very simple.

77
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:30,093
A single static PowerPoint slide is allowed.

78
00:06:30,093 --> 00:06:33,096
No animations or transitions.

79
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:35,639
Presentations must be spoken word.

80
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,841
No rap, no poems, no singing.

81
00:06:39,203 --> 00:06:42,166
No props, no sound effects or video files.

82
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:47,231
Just the speaker, their slide, and their ability to engage us.

83
00:06:48,132 --> 00:06:51,896
Each presentation cannot be longer than three minutes.

84
00:06:51,896 --> 00:06:55,898
Exceeding the time limit will result in disqualification.

85
00:06:55,898 --> 00:07:01,165
we extend our sincere gratitude to the 10 graduate students competing today.

86
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:04,350
By stepping onto this stage, they have embraced the

87
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,494
challenge of sharing their research to the public.

88
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:11,220
A heartfelt thanks also goes to our esteemed panel

89
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,785
of judges who will evaluate today's presentations on

90
00:07:14,785 --> 00:07:22,075
four key factors, comprehension, content, engagement, and communication.

91
00:07:23,658 --> 00:07:27,063
We'll start with Walid Abdulladi, Executive Director of

92
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:33,614
the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Studies and also Professor of Geography.

93
00:07:33,614 --> 00:07:34,836
Thank you, Walid.

94
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:41,887
Next, we have Jared Bahir-Brauch, Director of Critical

95
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:46,434
Sports Studies and Assistant Teaching Professor in Ethnic Studies.

96
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:47,235
Thank you, Jared.

97
00:07:49,645 --> 00:07:55,392
Sonia De Luca Fernandez, Senior Vice Chancellor for Leadership, Engagement and Support.

98
00:07:56,213 --> 00:07:56,893
Thank you, Sonia.

99
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:05,423
And Robert Streeter, Site Supervisor at Polar Field Services.

100
00:08:05,423 --> 00:08:08,807
Now, Robert is also a graduate of the CU Boulder

101
00:08:08,807 --> 00:08:13,693
Graduate School and the winner of the 3MT competition in 2023.

102
00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:16,716
Thank you, Robert.

103
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:22,825
While our judges will determine the first place winner

104
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:28,071
and the runner-up, you will decide the People's Choice Award winner.

105
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:31,814
As you watch today's presentations, consider which speaker

106
00:08:31,814 --> 00:08:40,343
captures your imagination, makes their research accessible, and sparks your curiosity to learn more.

107
00:08:41,164 --> 00:08:44,448
After the final speaker today, a QR code will be placed

108
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:47,631
on the screen where you can cast your vote.

109
00:08:48,505 --> 00:08:54,535
At its core, 3MT is about storytelling, about sharing

110
00:08:54,535 --> 00:09:00,345
new ideas, discoveries, and perspectives in a way that resonates with us all.

111
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:06,316
On this chilly day, we gather around the proverbial fire

112
00:09:06,316 --> 00:09:13,548
to listen, learn, and be inspired by our next exciting generation of scholars.

113
00:09:13,548 --> 00:09:16,072
Now, let's get started.

114
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:20,039
The presentation order has been already randomly assigned, so

115
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:26,770
first up, I'd like to invite Casey Hunt, PhD candidate at the Atlas Institute.

116
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,855
The title of their presentation is Building a Shared

117
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:34,442
Future, a Toolkit for Collaborative Robot Design.

118
00:09:42,168 --> 00:09:44,450
Robots are the future.

119
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:49,234
They make work safer, reduce the cost of goods, and

120
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:53,238
support exploration into deep oceans and outer space.

121
00:09:53,238 --> 00:09:55,780
And that's just a few of the things that they can do.

122
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,343
But what will our robot future look like?

123
00:09:58,343 --> 00:10:01,746
Will it be user friendly and community focused?

124
00:10:01,746 --> 00:10:03,548
That depends on who builds it.

125
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:07,511
To create a future filled with safe and relevant

126
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:12,205
robots, engineers must collaborate with the stakeholders of our designs.

127
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:15,208
Valuing stakeholder knowledge leads to robots that are

128
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:21,155
more trustworthy and require less fine-tuning, saving resources, and increasing adoption.

129
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:25,360
For example, a medical robot is more likely to

130
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,784
reflect the realities of hospitals if engineers prioritize

131
00:10:28,784 --> 00:10:32,628
the perspectives of doctors, nurses, and patient advocates.

132
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:39,070
During my PhD, I've helped facilitate stakeholder-driven robot design.

133
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,855
What I learned is that these processes are invaluable, but they can be complicated.

134
00:10:43,855 --> 00:10:48,461
One challenge is that when we imagine robots with stakeholders,

135
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:53,647
we have to use techniques that are accessible to everyone, like crafting and brainstorming.

136
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:58,412
We learn a lot from these exercises, but their simplicity can be limiting.

137
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:01,516
For instance, it's pretty hard to build a detailed

138
00:11:01,516 --> 00:11:08,213
robot prototype with pipe cleaners, so even valuable outcomes can be limiting and vague.

139
00:11:08,213 --> 00:11:11,299
My research asks, is it possible to design a

140
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:15,887
technique that leads to more fruitful collaborations with robot stakeholders?

141
00:11:15,887 --> 00:11:19,393
And could this technique be inexpensive and easily remixed

142
00:11:19,393 --> 00:11:22,861
to the many contexts where robots solve important problems?

143
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:25,345
To explore this question, I use a research

144
00:11:25,345 --> 00:11:28,350
through design approach, surveying literature from robotics

145
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:34,400
education and design, interviewing experts, and creating hundreds of prototypes with my collaborators.

146
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,745
The result is a promising solution, a kit of 3D

147
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:40,970
printed joints and connectors that when combined with PVC

148
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,237
pipe, facilitate approachable and playful robot prototyping.

149
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:49,464
The kit is educational, teaching non-engineers about robots

150
00:11:49,464 --> 00:11:53,931
as they create, while giving engineers the tools to convey precise technical ideas.

151
00:11:54,732 --> 00:11:58,238
In testing, the kit has been transformative, supporting

152
00:11:58,238 --> 00:12:03,185
stakeholders to create detailed prototypes of their ideas,

153
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:06,951
reducing ambiguity and fostering mutual understanding.

154
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:09,757
As a result, collaborations using the kit

155
00:12:09,757 --> 00:12:13,631
give engineers clear foundations that they can build on.

156
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:17,345
Next, I'll explore the wide range of contexts the

157
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:21,420
kit could be used with elderly adults, firefighters, and children.

158
00:12:22,312 --> 00:12:24,517
Although it sounds simple, this kit is a carefully

159
00:12:24,517 --> 00:12:28,024
engineered solution to one of robotics most persistent challenges,

160
00:12:28,024 --> 00:12:30,930
how to ensure all stakeholders have a voice.

161
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,219
By supporting engineers to create robots that align with

162
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:40,290
people's needs and values, I helped create a future that we can all be excited about.

163
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:40,911
Thank you.

164
00:12:49,818 --> 00:12:52,923
As you heard from Dean Adler, CU Boulder is home

165
00:12:52,923 --> 00:12:58,611
to nearly 6,000 graduate students, spread over 130 different programs.

166
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,116
As our judges need time to evaluate the presenters,

167
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:05,681
I'll be asking these incredible students some questions about what

168
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:08,245
they do when they're not doing their research.

169
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:12,893
So Casey, I understand that you like to go camping and hiking.

170
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:16,178
Where are your go-to spots for camping and hiking?

171
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:18,623
Yeah, well my family is from the San Luis Valley and

172
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:21,287
so we love to go camp in southern Colorado and one of the

173
00:13:21,287 --> 00:13:23,711
places we like to camp is at Valley View Hot Springs.

174
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:27,077
So we'll go camp on the side of the mountain and we take a dip in the springs.

175
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:29,421
It's super awesome, yeah.

176
00:13:29,421 --> 00:13:30,483
That sounds fantastic.

177
00:13:30,483 --> 00:13:33,628
Yes, hot spring sounds really good on a day like today.

178
00:13:34,587 --> 00:13:39,955
Like many people in this room, our graduate students are under a lot of stress.

179
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:44,922
And food and the idea of food can be very comforting.

180
00:13:44,922 --> 00:13:49,789
Now Casey, I understand that one of your go-to foods is a tomato sandwich.

181
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:53,875
So can you give us your recipe for that perfect tomato sandwich?

182
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,918
Yeah, it's like the perfect late night snack.

183
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,202
It's toast with a little bit of mayonnaise.

184
00:13:58,202 --> 00:14:00,946
You put some really good sliced tomato and then salt

185
00:14:00,946 --> 00:14:03,469
and pepper and then obviously the second piece of bread.

186
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:03,970
It's so good.

187
00:14:05,182 --> 00:14:07,605
You're going to hear a lot about food today.

188
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:10,709
There is a reception after all the presentations, so we're

189
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:13,111
not just tempting you and then saying, no food.

190
00:14:13,111 --> 00:14:14,153
You will get food.

191
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:18,478
Unfortunately, no tomato sandwiches, but they'll be good stuff.

192
00:14:18,478 --> 00:14:22,843
Now, some of us are very lucky to have inspiration to give focus and meaning to our work.

193
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:26,545
Would you please tell us about your great aunt?

194
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:30,951
Yeah, so when I first got interested in doing the PhD,

195
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:34,236
my grandma would not stop talking about my great Aunt Eva.

196
00:14:34,236 --> 00:14:37,400
So Aunt Eva is the only person I share DNA with who

197
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:45,671
has gotten a PhD, and she helps teach English as a second language speakers in the San Luis Valley English.

198
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:47,954
So she developed new techniques for doing this, and

199
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,117
she was specifically focused on Spanish speakers because

200
00:14:50,117 --> 00:14:54,220
there's a significant population of Spanish speakers in that area.

201
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,462
Great.

202
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:56,624
Thank you, Casey.

203
00:14:56,624 --> 00:14:57,445
Thank you so much.

204
00:14:57,445 --> 00:15:10,544
Thank you.

205
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:16,093
Our next presenter is Anna Turner, PhD candidate in media studies.

206
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:20,920
The title of their presentation is Building Bridges Through Popular Media.

207
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,324
How many of you have been to show on Netflix or any streaming service?

208
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:38,153
What if I told you that by watching television, you could actually be helping the United States?

209
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:40,275
I know, right?

210
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:42,498
I'm going to show you how.

211
00:15:42,498 --> 00:15:44,600
But first, I'd like to tell you a story.

212
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,944
This is a story of two different people.

213
00:15:47,944 --> 00:15:51,342
They actually have a lot in common, but they don't know it.

214
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:58,199
You would think that they should get along, but they have one big difference.

215
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:01,487
The first person is a member of team A, and the second

216
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:05,557
person is a member of the rival team, team B. So how do

217
00:16:05,557 --> 00:16:08,203
we get the first person and the second person to get along?

218
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,646
This is where my research comes in.

219
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:16,995
Team A is actually the Democrats and Team B is the Republicans.

220
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:19,139
They have very different views on certain things and

221
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:22,045
they dislike each other because they're members of opposite teams.

222
00:16:23,227 --> 00:16:25,351
This is a problem known as polarization.

223
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,637
One of the issues with polarization is that we're not

224
00:16:28,637 --> 00:16:32,703
often exposed to other viewpoints or to people unlike ourselves.

225
00:16:32,703 --> 00:16:35,207
The Republicans, for example, tend to be white living

226
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:38,131
in rural areas, whereas many Democrats are people of color

227
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:42,378
or members of the LGBTQ plus community living in urban areas.

228
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:46,624
And while there are exceptions to these generalizations, the fact

229
00:16:46,624 --> 00:16:51,251
is that many of us on opposite sides of the political spectrum don't often interact.

230
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:54,676
The one place that we can interact with

231
00:16:54,676 --> 00:16:58,723
people from different geographic locations, socioeconomic statuses, and

232
00:16:58,723 --> 00:17:01,647
a number of other characteristics is through media.

233
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:04,708
but not news media.

234
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,232
The news polarizes us more.

235
00:17:08,213 --> 00:17:12,839
But popular culture, like television, doesn't have the same baggage.

236
00:17:14,261 --> 00:17:16,704
For my research design, I've run an experiment to

237
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:20,830
see whether exposure to people unlike ourselves can give us an experience that unites us.

238
00:17:21,871 --> 00:17:25,035
Participants in my research watched a short clip of a

239
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:31,478
political drama on Netflix and then took a survey to measure their levels of polarization.

240
00:17:31,478 --> 00:17:34,422
While the findings are not yet confirmed, I'm hoping

241
00:17:34,422 --> 00:17:38,126
to show that diverse characters and dialogue can depolarize.

242
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:42,372
The key here is that networks and streaming services

243
00:17:42,372 --> 00:17:46,076
must begin to consciously craft messages to allow for this exposure.

244
00:17:47,418 --> 00:17:51,463
Similar to how media companies hire diversity officers,

245
00:17:51,463 --> 00:17:56,993
they could also employ experts in political polarization and popular culture, like me,

246
00:17:56,993 --> 00:18:02,183
to consult on diverse characters and dialogue that represent both sides of the aisle.

247
00:18:02,183 --> 00:18:06,552
This is a slow and ongoing process, but if we can

248
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,978
get media companies on board, we could see bridges being built

249
00:18:09,978 --> 00:18:14,968
through television and a more united Team A and Team B. Thank you.

250
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:25,071
So I understand that you're a runner.

251
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:28,655
What are some of your favorite trails or routes?

252
00:18:28,655 --> 00:18:35,283
Oh, I am usually a treadmill runner because I am terrified of ice.

253
00:18:35,283 --> 00:18:36,805
I'm terrified of ice and snow.

254
00:18:37,746 --> 00:18:42,432
But the amazing thing about Boulder is all of the bike and running tasks.

255
00:18:42,432 --> 00:18:48,040
So I can pick a different one every time I go in the summer when it's not snowing and slippery.

256
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,324
That was going to be my next question.

257
00:18:50,324 --> 00:18:52,487
What temperature is your cutoff spot?

258
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:59,778
I'm from Florida, so probably like 60, 70 degrees really, like in the summer.

259
00:18:59,778 --> 00:19:00,419
I'm with you.

260
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:01,160
I'm from Texas.

261
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:06,789
So we found out that Casey enjoys a good tomato sandwich.

262
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:10,214
I hear that you go with mac and cheese.

263
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:12,800
So any particular brand or recipe?

264
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:17,552
I really like Gouda in my mac and cheese but the best

265
00:19:17,552 --> 00:19:20,198
thing about mac and cheese is that there are a million

266
00:19:20,198 --> 00:19:23,165
different cheeses and you can make it different every time.

267
00:19:24,027 --> 00:19:28,017
So that's why I like it so much and because cheese.

268
00:19:28,017 --> 00:19:31,120
And we're going to hear more about cheese later too, so it's a thread.

269
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:37,146
So some people collect baseball cards, some people collect Disney characters.

270
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:40,990
I understand that you collect dogs.

271
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,692
Pugs, in particular.

272
00:19:42,692 --> 00:19:43,873
Yeah, I collect pugs.

273
00:19:44,894 --> 00:19:48,597
Not like figurines, like actual dog, pug dogs.

274
00:19:48,597 --> 00:19:51,560
So I've had up to three at one time.

275
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,123
I fostered for the Florida Pug Rescue.

276
00:19:54,123 --> 00:20:01,892
And I'm only down to one now, but he's 15 and he's still kicking and he is such a good boy.

277
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:07,880
So right now I'm only at one, but I have been known to have a grumble actually.

278
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,305
The collective noun for pugs is a grumble, so I used to have a grumble.

279
00:20:12,305 --> 00:20:16,710
These things that you never would have known if you hadn't come today.

280
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,093
So what's the name of your pug?

281
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,560
So did you practice your 3MT presentation to her me?

282
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,983
Oh, he knows it like that.

283
00:20:27,048 --> 00:20:31,978
So if we see a pug walking around talking about media, it's yours.

284
00:20:31,978 --> 00:20:33,087
Yeah, mine.

285
00:20:33,087 --> 00:20:37,375
So I understand you also like to binge watch.

286
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:40,120
What's the most recent binge?

287
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:45,911
I have been on this cop show kick, I guess, and firefighting kick.

288
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:51,110
So I'm watching Station 19 and The Rookie right now, both on Hulu.

289
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,432
Do you recommend them?

290
00:20:52,432 --> 00:20:56,059
Yeah, I actually like both of them a lot, in fact.

291
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:59,185
SWOT is also actually a really good one, and it's one

292
00:20:59,185 --> 00:21:06,819
I'd like to research later because they do a good job of showing both sides of opinions.

293
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:08,222
Very good.

294
00:21:08,222 --> 00:21:09,103
Well, thank you so much, Anna.

295
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:09,945
Thank you, bud.

296
00:21:16,422 --> 00:21:19,728
As you heard, unfortunately, one of our presenters today is

297
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:24,696
ill, so Heiko will not be presenting for us today.

298
00:21:24,696 --> 00:21:30,205
But next, we do have Celeste Giles, PhD candidate in aerospace engineering.

299
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:37,738
The title of their presentation today is Bringing You Safely Home from Outer Space.

300
00:21:44,182 --> 00:21:48,992
Imagine you're coming home after a luxurious sightseeing vacation on the moon.

301
00:21:48,992 --> 00:21:52,159
As your spacecraft begins to enter Earth's atmosphere, you

302
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,187
start to hear strange noises, feel vibrations, and see pieces

303
00:21:56,187 --> 00:21:58,973
of spacecraft fly by outside your tiny window.

304
00:21:58,973 --> 00:22:01,498
Will you make it safely back to Earth?

305
00:22:02,457 --> 00:22:05,521
My research is on entry vehicle heat shields, the

306
00:22:05,521 --> 00:22:09,726
protective layer critical in ensuring your spacecraft survives that

307
00:22:09,726 --> 00:22:13,511
high-speed entry as you get pulled by gravity back down to

308
00:22:13,511 --> 00:22:16,775
Earth and that you stay nice and cool the entire time.

309
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:21,000
These heat shields have been used for over 70 years.

310
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,023
However, much is still not known about them.

311
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:27,529
As we continue to explore space and build heat shields,

312
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:33,118
it has been discovered that there are differences between the predictive models and actual flight data.

313
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,781
This is very concerning.

314
00:22:34,781 --> 00:22:37,666
These heat shields need to reliably protect people from

315
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:41,873
the very hot plasma formed around the spacecraft as it

316
00:22:41,873 --> 00:22:45,980
enters an atmosphere and make sure the spacecraft doesn't completely burn up.

317
00:22:47,262 --> 00:22:49,626
So, how does my research come in?

318
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,785
I get to test heating up small pieces of heat shield

319
00:22:53,785 --> 00:23:00,355
to 10 times the temperature of boiling water, see how they decompose, and what they decompose into.

320
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:06,764
Similar to wood, when it burns, these heat shields blacken and char when they're heated.

321
00:23:06,764 --> 00:23:11,631
After testing many different heating scenarios, I measure

322
00:23:11,631 --> 00:23:17,348
each sample's mass loss, density, and decomposition products.

323
00:23:17,348 --> 00:23:20,351
My favorite part is I can even reconstruct the

324
00:23:20,351 --> 00:23:24,714
actual chemical mechanisms involved in the decomposition of these heat shields.

325
00:23:25,976 --> 00:23:29,719
After testing multiple different types of heat shields, I

326
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:33,302
discovered that the density of the heat shield matters a lot.

327
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:38,707
Similar to wood when it burns, these heat shields produce gases when they are heated.

328
00:23:38,707 --> 00:23:42,390
If the heat shield is too dense, these gases build up

329
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,255
inside causing bubbles and cracks to form in the heat shield.

330
00:23:46,255 --> 00:23:48,778
This is not good for an actual heat shield.

331
00:23:48,778 --> 00:23:52,643
These bubbles and cracks can harm the structural integrity, cause

332
00:23:52,643 --> 00:23:57,910
pieces to fly off, or cause the heat shield to completely fall apart.

333
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:01,614
Also, the very hot gases formed around the heat shield

334
00:24:01,614 --> 00:24:06,040
can make its way through these cracks, closer to the spacecraft and people inside.

335
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,952
To improve,

336
00:24:08,952 --> 00:24:12,856
Our understanding of the decomposition of these heat shields, I

337
00:24:12,856 --> 00:24:18,563
share my data on the gas products and chemical mechanisms with the scientific community.

338
00:24:19,504 --> 00:24:23,468
To improve the models involved with these heat shields, I

339
00:24:23,468 --> 00:24:26,972
share my data with modelers who then improve their models,

340
00:24:26,972 --> 00:24:32,819
making sure you can reliably and safely land after your moon vacation.

341
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:36,082
Or if you're super adventurous, help you visit Mars.

342
00:24:36,082 --> 00:24:36,563
Thank you.

343
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:48,419
So we have to get this out of the way first, especially given the weather.

344
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:51,144
Please tell people where your hometown is.

345
00:24:51,144 --> 00:24:52,848
I grew up in Honolulu, Hawaii.

346
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,952
I'm not used to the cold.

347
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:57,918
Can we all just be a teeny bit jealous?

348
00:24:57,918 --> 00:24:58,680
OK.

349
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,307
What would be the temperature approximately in Honolulu right now?

350
00:25:02,307 --> 00:25:05,213
Average is always nice 80.

351
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:12,584
I right now I can't even imagine 80 so I'm my gosh up like many of us

352
00:25:12,584 --> 00:25:15,989
where we grow up affects the foods that we come to

353
00:25:15,989 --> 00:25:20,535
love and I understand that your favorite is chicken katsu curry

354
00:25:20,535 --> 00:25:25,362
and please tell us what's in chicken katsu curry chicken katsu

355
00:25:25,362 --> 00:25:33,239
breaded deep-fried chicken, and the curry is a Japanese golden curry, very basic, but delicious.

356
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:35,042
And served with?

357
00:25:35,042 --> 00:25:36,385
Some rice.

358
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:37,247
There we go.

359
00:25:37,247 --> 00:25:38,971
Have to have the whole package there.

360
00:25:40,013 --> 00:25:42,057
So we already talked about some collections.

361
00:25:42,057 --> 00:25:45,477
Anna has Pugs, and you have a?

362
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,140
collections.

363
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,602
What kind of rocks do you collect?

364
00:25:48,602 --> 00:25:49,984
Oh, all sorts.

365
00:25:49,984 --> 00:25:53,430
It started with my great uncle who was a geologist for

366
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:59,660
the Bank of America and I inherited some of his collections and then added from there.

367
00:26:00,621 --> 00:26:02,063
So do you have a favorite?

368
00:26:03,446 --> 00:26:06,651
No, they're all precious.

369
00:26:06,651 --> 00:26:09,794
Okay, do you have a favorite collection story?

370
00:26:09,794 --> 00:26:16,703
Let's see, a good one is we used to collect agates from the West Coast beach.

371
00:26:16,703 --> 00:26:21,989
They're like clear rocks you can look up in the sun and see through and they're very pretty.

372
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,792
Fabulous, love that.

373
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,055
I understand that you practice kendo.

374
00:26:27,055 --> 00:26:30,299
Would you please tell folks who don't know what kendo is first?

375
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:36,687
Kendo is a Japanese stored martial art I started last semester here at CU actually.

376
00:26:36,687 --> 00:26:37,388
Oh my goodness.

377
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,032
So beware, you know, out in the hallway.

378
00:26:43,032 --> 00:26:45,518
So I understand you have two cats?

379
00:26:45,518 --> 00:26:46,039
I do.

380
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:49,066
They've been helping me through grad school.

381
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,291
And have you practiced your presentation to them?

382
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:51,873
I have.

383
00:26:51,873 --> 00:26:54,419
They just stare at me in disdain.

384
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:57,486
So does one like outer space more than the other one?

385
00:26:59,727 --> 00:27:04,618
I believe my fluffy cat named Lily might like outer space more.

386
00:27:04,618 --> 00:27:07,244
So we have Lily and... Noodle.

387
00:27:07,244 --> 00:27:08,046
Noodle.

388
00:27:08,046 --> 00:27:10,231
Are they siblings?

389
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:13,438
No, they're just rescue mama cats.

390
00:27:13,438 --> 00:27:15,042
Fabulous, fabulous.

391
00:27:15,042 --> 00:27:16,565
Thank you all very much.

392
00:27:16,565 --> 00:27:17,247
Thank you.

393
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:29,694
Next up, we have Casey Middleton, PhD candidate in computer science.

394
00:27:29,694 --> 00:27:33,398
The title of their presentation is Testing.

395
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:34,639
Testing.

396
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:36,141
One, two, three.

397
00:27:36,141 --> 00:27:43,608
It's two days before grandma's birthday and you haven't seen her in ages.

398
00:27:43,608 --> 00:27:45,991
But you're starting to feel a little sniffle coming on

399
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:47,953
and you really don't want to get grandma sick.

400
00:27:48,894 --> 00:27:52,580
Luckily, you have a few COVID-19 rapid tests in your cabinet.

401
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,581
When should you use them?

402
00:27:54,682 --> 00:27:57,105
Maybe you take one now so you can tell grandma your plans.

403
00:27:58,207 --> 00:27:59,268
But what if it's negative?

404
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:00,930
Do you take another one?

405
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:02,251
When?

406
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:07,898
We know that even if you do have COVID-19, a test isn't guaranteed to detect you.

407
00:28:07,898 --> 00:28:11,963
Rapid tests require us to have lots of virus in our system.

408
00:28:11,963 --> 00:28:15,167
Too little virus and you'll test negative even if you really are sick.

409
00:28:16,148 --> 00:28:20,879
And in fact, the amount of virus you have changes throughout your course of infection.

410
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:22,802
A typical infection might look something like this.

411
00:28:24,846 --> 00:28:27,630
At that first inhale of virus, only a few virus particles

412
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:32,598
take root in the lungs, but that number grows super quickly as the virus replicates in the first few days.

413
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,046
Eventually, your immune system kicks in and starts to reduce the amount of virus.

414
00:28:38,248 --> 00:28:40,391
If we knew when your symptoms started during this course

415
00:28:40,391 --> 00:28:44,177
of infection, maybe we could tell you if you have enough virus to test positive.

416
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:47,997
This is the idea that sparked my research question.

417
00:28:47,997 --> 00:28:50,460
can we predict the effectiveness of different testing

418
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,947
recommendations, considering what we know about how the virus behaves during an infection?

419
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:59,793
But we know that not everyone's infection looks exactly the same.

420
00:28:59,793 --> 00:29:02,737
So first, I needed data from lots of infections.

421
00:29:03,578 --> 00:29:06,763
To get this data, I dove into the literature, collecting

422
00:29:06,763 --> 00:29:10,949
data from as many studies as I could find, focusing on three key ingredients.

423
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:16,297
One, how much virus do people typically have throughout their infection?

424
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:18,659
Two, when do their symptoms typically start?

425
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,543
And three, how much virus does our tests need to detect you?

426
00:29:23,784 --> 00:29:25,826
Now I had a ton of data, but I still needed

427
00:29:25,826 --> 00:29:28,149
some way to synthesize that data to answer my question.

428
00:29:28,969 --> 00:29:31,372
To do this, I created a rigorous mathematical

429
00:29:31,372 --> 00:29:36,216
framework combining probability theory and calculus to help us predict testing effectiveness.

430
00:29:37,197 --> 00:29:40,501
Now, I find multivariable calculus really exciting.

431
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:43,704
But sadly, we don't have time for a whiteboarding session today.

432
00:29:44,605 --> 00:29:46,756
But I can tell you what I found.

433
00:29:46,756 --> 00:29:49,479
For any virus, it's typically best to test right before

434
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:54,283
you visit grandma, because a negative test today doesn't guarantee that you won't infect her tomorrow.

435
00:29:55,224 --> 00:29:57,646
And I also found a surprising result for COVID-19.

436
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:00,989
If you only have a few rapid tests in your cabinet,

437
00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:03,732
you should wait two days after your symptoms start to use them.

438
00:30:04,713 --> 00:30:08,296
This is because our immune systems are primed and ready for COVID-19.

439
00:30:08,296 --> 00:30:11,379
So symptoms start early, even when you haven't built up much virus yet.

440
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,752
And our lessons don't stop at COVID.

441
00:30:14,752 --> 00:30:16,655
The beauty of the math is that it can help us

442
00:30:16,655 --> 00:30:20,502
make better testing choices for other viruses, too, from flu

443
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:24,029
to RSV to even new viruses we haven't discovered yet.

444
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:28,397
The math I developed can help us make better testing choices for any virus.

445
00:30:28,397 --> 00:30:29,919
And I like to think this helps us do a

446
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,528
better job protecting grandmas and three-minute thesis participants everywhere.

447
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:39,156
Thank you.

448
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,081
Thank you, Casey.

449
00:30:42,922 --> 00:30:49,729
So I understand that your path to becoming a computer scientist has been anything but linear.

450
00:30:49,729 --> 00:30:50,369
Indeed.

451
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:54,893
Would you share with us some of the jobs that you've had before you arrived in Boulder?

452
00:30:54,893 --> 00:30:55,694
Yes.

453
00:30:55,694 --> 00:30:58,537
I was a certified pharmacy technician.

454
00:30:58,537 --> 00:31:01,119
I have been a Zumba instructor.

455
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:06,704
I've been a data scientist for a housing policy nonprofit,

456
00:31:06,704 --> 00:31:10,135
and I've also been a high school geometry teacher.

457
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:12,117
Yeah.

458
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:14,199
So how long were you a high school teacher?

459
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:15,780
I was a high school teacher for one year.

460
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,182
It was the hardest job I've ever had.

461
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:20,385
I think we can all agree on that.

462
00:31:20,385 --> 00:31:21,806
Yeah, mad respect.

463
00:31:21,806 --> 00:31:25,590
So do you have a story take away from that experience?

464
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:29,894
I guess from being a high school teacher, it taught me a lot about empathy

465
00:31:29,894 --> 00:31:32,457
and how you never know what people are going through

466
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:35,940
because I was trying to teach my kids geometry and they had

467
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,143
so many problems that were not just my geometry homework.

468
00:31:39,143 --> 00:31:41,547
You had nothing to do with your geometry.

469
00:31:41,547 --> 00:31:43,110
Yeah, they actually really didn't care.

470
00:31:44,933 --> 00:31:45,594
There's that.

471
00:31:47,017 --> 00:31:54,770
So you also have a very eclectic palette of sports that you participate in.

472
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:55,932
It's boulder.

473
00:31:55,932 --> 00:31:56,753
It is boulder.

474
00:31:56,753 --> 00:31:58,857
But even for boulder, this is pretty good.

475
00:31:58,857 --> 00:32:02,944
Rock climbing, trail running, downhill, and backcountry skiing.

476
00:32:02,944 --> 00:32:03,565
Got to do both.

477
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:08,338
So, do you have any favorite trails or?

478
00:32:08,338 --> 00:32:12,265
Oh yeah, I will say that for hiking I really love

479
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:15,250
Royal Arch and it's so incredible that that's just right in our backyard.

480
00:32:16,051 --> 00:32:18,976
But this summer I was training for a trail marathon and

481
00:32:18,976 --> 00:32:22,602
I went to Golden Gate State Canyon when the leaves were just

482
00:32:22,602 --> 00:32:27,530
at peak changing and it was so beautiful and that was really fun and hard.

483
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,313
And hard, yes.

484
00:32:29,313 --> 00:32:32,829
So we've heard about tomato sandwiches, mac and cheese.

485
00:32:32,829 --> 00:32:36,653
I don't remember what I put for this question, bud.

486
00:32:36,653 --> 00:32:38,135
Oh, that sounds right, okay.

487
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:43,261
I have to remind her of her favorite food.

488
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,762
What is her favorite food?

489
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:47,386
Well, according to your paper, Bud, it is

490
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:50,990
homemade buttermilk biscuits with strawberry jelly because I'm from

491
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:54,073
Tennessee and that has to be my answer legally.

492
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:59,139
Yeah, and if your stomach is not growling by now, I don't know what is in store.

493
00:32:59,139 --> 00:33:01,182
But like I said, we will have food later.

494
00:33:01,182 --> 00:33:01,782
Thank you.

495
00:33:01,782 --> 00:33:04,045
Thank you, Bud.

496
00:33:11,855 --> 00:33:17,423
Next up, we have Nandi Pointer, PhD candidate in media studies.

497
00:33:17,423 --> 00:33:21,289
The title of their presentation is Exit to Entry,

498
00:33:21,289 --> 00:33:26,016
Black Expatriates Teaching English as a Fugitive Liberatory Practice.

499
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,856
Quote, when I'm in America, I'm black.

500
00:33:38,856 --> 00:33:41,656
When I'm abroad, I'm American.

501
00:33:41,656 --> 00:33:48,488
This comment by Troy Benson, a black English teacher from Wisconsin who lives

502
00:33:48,488 --> 00:33:52,996
and works in Iraq, affected me deeply because it cuts at

503
00:33:52,996 --> 00:33:57,865
the heart of a long history of black death and suffering in the U.S.

504
00:33:57,865 --> 00:34:01,214
that dates back to the transatlantic slave trade.

505
00:34:01,214 --> 00:34:04,999
From lynching photographs to cell phone videos of murder, this

506
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:08,224
history can be traced in the visual field, which has

507
00:34:08,224 --> 00:34:12,269
made the state violence that black people experience hyper visible.

508
00:34:13,411 --> 00:34:17,396
Reflecting on this history, Troy further told me, quote, I wish

509
00:34:17,396 --> 00:34:20,661
there was a country I could go to where I could be invisible.

510
00:34:21,462 --> 00:34:25,247
In America, we don't have that option, end quote.

511
00:34:26,088 --> 00:34:30,877
My dissertation, Exit to Entry, investigates the largely

512
00:34:30,877 --> 00:34:35,246
unstudied phenomenon of black men who leave the U.S.

513
00:34:35,246 --> 00:34:41,933
to work as English as a second language or ESL instructors in Asia and the Middle East.

514
00:34:41,933 --> 00:34:47,863
Focusing specifically on black expats in Iraq, Vietnam, and the Republic of Korea,

515
00:34:48,684 --> 00:34:52,490
I seek to understand how and why these men have taken

516
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:56,717
the path of teaching abroad as a fugitive practice of liberation.

517
00:34:57,979 --> 00:35:00,843
Drawing on my own personal experience as an ESL

518
00:35:00,843 --> 00:35:06,571
instructor, my dissertation is based on interviews with 20 black male expats.

519
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:12,857
Multimodal and innovative in nature, it incorporates writing and documentary filmmaking

520
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:19,103
as a method to tackle questions about race and identity, moving beyond the persisting

521
00:35:19,103 --> 00:35:24,128
and indeed harmful categories of classification, separation,

522
00:35:24,128 --> 00:35:28,131
and representation that have violently marked the black body in the US.

523
00:35:29,553 --> 00:35:32,856
Three primary questions motivate my dissertation project.

524
00:35:33,737 --> 00:35:34,803
One.

525
00:35:34,803 --> 00:35:39,330
How do black male expats re-articulate their identity, sense

526
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:43,797
of place and agency when located in context free of

527
00:35:43,797 --> 00:35:47,583
the violent ruptures of anti-blackness found in the US?

528
00:35:48,505 --> 00:35:54,214
Two, how does the context of education as an important historical vehicle

529
00:35:54,214 --> 00:35:57,379
for the movement and liberation of the black mind

530
00:35:57,379 --> 00:36:01,786
and body animate black teaching practices overseas?

531
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:06,772
And three, how do these expats navigate or potentially

532
00:36:06,772 --> 00:36:13,480
experience other structures of racism when located in context shaped by US wars and empire?

533
00:36:14,521 --> 00:36:17,905
In conclusion, I seek to better understand how these

534
00:36:17,905 --> 00:36:22,611
ESL teachers open up new horizons for thinking about black

535
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:26,525
male identity and racial justice in the US today.

536
00:36:26,525 --> 00:36:29,769
embracing life abroad as a way to free the black body

537
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:35,376
from what they perceive to be its limited expression and proximity to violence in the U.S.

538
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:35,817
Thank you.

539
00:36:43,066 --> 00:36:47,151
So, Nandi, as you mentioned in your presentation, she was

540
00:36:47,151 --> 00:36:50,515
a ESL, English as a Second Language instructor.

541
00:36:50,515 --> 00:36:52,457
Where did you do this?

542
00:36:52,457 --> 00:36:56,528
I taught English in the Republic of Korea, Vietnam, and Saudi Arabia.

543
00:36:56,528 --> 00:36:58,493
And how did that come to be?

544
00:36:58,493 --> 00:37:01,461
Well, I was actually inspired by my brother who was on one of the slides.

545
00:37:01,461 --> 00:37:04,289
He taught in Japan and then in Korea.

546
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,976
And after working at MTV in New York, he was like,

547
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:09,162
what do you think about living overseas for a year?

548
00:37:09,162 --> 00:37:10,349
And I was like,

549
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:11,611
where am I gonna get my hair done?

550
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:14,094
How am I gonna do that?

551
00:37:14,094 --> 00:37:17,118
But yeah, life changing experience.

552
00:37:17,118 --> 00:37:19,862
And so do you have a takeaway story from that experience?

553
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:20,963
From Korea?

554
00:37:20,963 --> 00:37:22,726
Or Vietnam?

555
00:37:22,726 --> 00:37:25,469
I have a funny one from Vietnam which is actually be

556
00:37:25,469 --> 00:37:29,515
careful because I was staying in this little apartment and I went out on the balcony.

557
00:37:29,515 --> 00:37:32,198
I had a little bitty balcony out in front of my little

558
00:37:32,198 --> 00:37:38,918
place and I went all of a sudden like I closed the doors and I heard the little lock like go down.

559
00:37:38,918 --> 00:37:42,183
And I guess the cleaning lady had locked it.

560
00:37:42,183 --> 00:37:43,825
I always just kept it locked.

561
00:37:43,825 --> 00:37:46,188
So me and my brother are out on the balcony.

562
00:37:46,188 --> 00:37:48,111
And I'm like, three stories up.

563
00:37:48,111 --> 00:37:50,494
How am I going to get back inside?

564
00:37:50,494 --> 00:37:51,676
And he's starting to get tense.

565
00:37:51,676 --> 00:37:53,178
And I'm like, I don't know.

566
00:37:53,178 --> 00:37:55,001
I don't know what to yell out in Vietnamese.

567
00:37:55,001 --> 00:37:57,604
It's like, help, or you know.

568
00:37:57,604 --> 00:37:59,607
Luckily, I was able to get down and slap.

569
00:37:59,607 --> 00:38:02,636
up and, you know, get back inside.

570
00:38:02,636 --> 00:38:05,064
Yeah, clearly y'all got back inside.

571
00:38:05,064 --> 00:38:06,167
Yeah, we got back inside.

572
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:07,933
It would have been a sadder story though.

573
00:38:07,933 --> 00:38:08,695
Oh, that wouldn't help.

574
00:38:08,695 --> 00:38:09,614
Not good.

575
00:38:09,614 --> 00:38:12,078
So I understand you have a dog, Ginger.

576
00:38:12,078 --> 00:38:13,219
Yes, Ginger.

577
00:38:13,219 --> 00:38:16,304
So did you practice your 3MT presentation to Ginger?

578
00:38:16,304 --> 00:38:16,865
I did.

579
00:38:16,865 --> 00:38:19,609
Actually, last night, when I was trying to do it, I guess

580
00:38:19,609 --> 00:38:24,276
her water bowl was a little low, and she gave me this aggressive bark.

581
00:38:24,276 --> 00:38:25,197
And I was like, what?

582
00:38:25,197 --> 00:38:27,741
You don't like my presentation?

583
00:38:27,741 --> 00:38:28,662
She wanted some water.

584
00:38:28,662 --> 00:38:30,485
It was OK.

585
00:38:30,485 --> 00:38:31,066
We never know.

586
00:38:31,066 --> 00:38:32,528
We never know.

587
00:38:32,528 --> 00:38:35,071
So I understand you also play a musical instrument.

588
00:38:35,071 --> 00:38:36,453
Yes, I play the flute.

589
00:38:36,453 --> 00:38:37,880
And when did that start?

590
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,806
That started in the fifth grade when I was living in Decorah, Iowa.

591
00:38:40,806 --> 00:38:45,877
We could take like little 30 minute lessons and part of our school day, like pretty amazing.

592
00:38:45,877 --> 00:38:47,500
So yeah, that's when I first started playing.

593
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,422
Do you still play?

594
00:38:48,422 --> 00:38:49,104
Yes, I do.

595
00:38:49,104 --> 00:38:50,266
Oh, how exciting.

596
00:38:50,266 --> 00:38:54,755
I just performed at the Cause Black History Month event with my brother and we played.

597
00:38:54,755 --> 00:38:55,437
Fantastic.

598
00:38:55,437 --> 00:38:55,998
Oh my gosh.

599
00:38:55,998 --> 00:38:56,459
Yeah.

600
00:38:56,459 --> 00:39:02,636
So many of the candidates wrote a fun fact about their

601
00:39:02,636 --> 00:39:10,432
life and I have to admit my inner fangirl kind of went into hyperdrive when I read that you are the niece of

602
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:11,393
The Pointer Sisters.

603
00:39:12,755 --> 00:39:17,903
And so, for anybody who maybe grew up under a rock, who were the Pointer Sisters?

604
00:39:17,903 --> 00:39:22,150
Well, there's a legendary group during the 70s and 80s.

605
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:25,795
They actually won one of the first country Grammys for a

606
00:39:25,795 --> 00:39:29,761
fairy tale written by my aunt Anita, May She Rest In Peace.

607
00:39:29,761 --> 00:39:32,024
And so, yeah, it was pretty fun having them as

608
00:39:32,024 --> 00:39:35,670
these pioneering black women with these amazing voices growing up.

609
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,892
Amazing voices.

610
00:39:36,892 --> 00:39:37,853
Yeah, the harmonies.

611
00:39:37,853 --> 00:39:40,638
Yeah, and I had to, of course, do a little research of

612
00:39:40,638 --> 00:39:43,323
my own, not only winning the Grammy in the country category,

613
00:39:43,323 --> 00:39:48,132
but they were the first female group to perform in the Grand Ole Opry.

614
00:39:48,132 --> 00:39:51,318
So trailblazers, as well as being brilliant musicians.

615
00:39:51,318 --> 00:39:53,743
Yes, very proud.

616
00:39:53,743 --> 00:39:54,464
Thank you.

617
00:39:54,464 --> 00:39:57,550
Thank you so much.

618
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:09,690
Next up, we have Marwa Yakuchi, PhD candidate in aerospace engineering.

619
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:15,158
The title of their presentation is Unveiling the Hidden Stories of Materials.

620
00:40:20,245 --> 00:40:25,728
What does training an Olympic athlete have in common with sending materials to space?

621
00:40:25,728 --> 00:40:30,012
Picture this, you are training an Olympic athlete for the competition of their life.

622
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:35,396
You analyze everything, the athlete's weaknesses and strengths to ensure a peak performance.

623
00:40:36,457 --> 00:40:39,440
Imagine if you can foresee the challenges this athlete would

624
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,663
face before they even step onto the field.

625
00:40:42,663 --> 00:40:47,307
You'd know how their body would react to each hill, rough terrain, and blazing sun.

626
00:40:48,868 --> 00:40:54,415
Now, think about applying that kind of foresight to the materials that build our world.

627
00:40:54,415 --> 00:40:59,061
Like athletes, materials have their own challenges, especially

628
00:40:59,061 --> 00:41:03,166
in the space environment, from extreme temperatures to radiation.

629
00:41:04,108 --> 00:41:05,830
What if I told you that we could predict

630
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:11,097
how materials respond under those extreme conditions before they are even created?

631
00:41:12,098 --> 00:41:14,040
That is exactly what I'm working on.

632
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:22,175
My research asks, how can we use AI to design materials capable of thriving in space?

633
00:41:22,175 --> 00:41:24,938
Think of it as mapping the story of the material

634
00:41:24,938 --> 00:41:31,505
before it's created, ensuring every challenge it faces is accounted for before it ever leaves the lab.

635
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:36,250
Spacecraft heat shields, for example, inter-temperatures nearly have

636
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,874
as hot as this one, protecting astronauts and equipment.

637
00:41:39,874 --> 00:41:43,197
While we have heat-resistant materials, we need ones that

638
00:41:43,197 --> 00:41:45,720
are lighter, reusable, and faster to produce.

639
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:50,004
The challenge is finding the right material combination.

640
00:41:50,004 --> 00:41:51,301
So to do this,

641
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:54,787
I've developed computational models, mathematical tools that

642
00:41:54,787 --> 00:41:56,870
combine physics with artificial intelligence.

643
00:41:57,852 --> 00:42:02,900
First, I gather data on material properties like strength and heat resistance.

644
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,566
Then I use AI to uncover patterns within that data.

645
00:42:07,367 --> 00:42:10,933
So instead of spending months physically testing thousands

646
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:17,123
of material combinations, AI helps us identify the most promising candidates in minutes.

647
00:42:18,031 --> 00:42:19,514
But here is the twist.

648
00:42:19,514 --> 00:42:21,958
AI doesn't replace physical testing.

649
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,326
It guides us to smarter choices faster.

650
00:42:26,326 --> 00:42:32,662
We take AI's predictions to the lab, refining materials to meet the required standards.

651
00:42:32,662 --> 00:42:37,870
What once took months of trial and error can now begin with AI-powered guidance.

652
00:42:39,272 --> 00:42:41,595
One of the most surprising things I've found throughout

653
00:42:41,595 --> 00:42:46,222
this journey is that, like people, materials have hidden stories.

654
00:42:46,222 --> 00:42:49,948
They respond differently under pressure sometimes and in unexpected ways.

655
00:42:49,948 --> 00:42:53,152
And machine learning helps me uncover these stories, teach us

656
00:42:53,152 --> 00:42:57,417
lessons that could one day lead to breakthroughs in material design.

657
00:42:57,417 --> 00:43:02,106
So next time you watch an Olympic athlete deliver a flawless performance, remember,

658
00:43:02,106 --> 00:43:06,133
behind that success is careful preparation and foresight, just

659
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:12,004
like the work we do to ensure materials not just survive in space, but thrive.

660
00:43:12,004 --> 00:43:12,365
Thank you.

661
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:19,879
Thank you, Marwa.

662
00:43:19,879 --> 00:43:20,620
Thank you.

663
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:23,563
To give yourself a break from your rigorous graduate

664
00:43:23,563 --> 00:43:28,408
studies, I understand that you enjoy reading of horror novels.

665
00:43:28,408 --> 00:43:29,789
Yes, I do.

666
00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:32,993
So any titles or authors that you recommend?

667
00:43:32,993 --> 00:43:35,355
Oh, that's a tough question.

668
00:43:35,355 --> 00:43:40,501
It definitely should be a Stephen King book.

669
00:43:40,501 --> 00:43:42,423
I recommend The Pet Sematary.

670
00:43:42,423 --> 00:43:44,445
I like that one.

671
00:43:44,445 --> 00:43:47,047
I assume you've read this multiple times, it sounds like.

672
00:43:47,047 --> 00:43:47,708
Yeah, I love it.

673
00:43:48,953 --> 00:43:54,800
So I understand you like reading horror novels but not watching horror movies.

674
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,180
Exactly.

675
00:43:56,062 --> 00:43:58,404
There is a movie for the bit symmetry act.

676
00:43:58,404 --> 00:43:59,846
I've never watched it.

677
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:00,887
I don't know.

678
00:44:00,887 --> 00:44:02,049
I can't handle that.

679
00:44:02,049 --> 00:44:06,614
Just the jump scares and everything in a horror movie.

680
00:44:06,614 --> 00:44:07,055
No.

681
00:44:07,055 --> 00:44:08,176
That's enough for me.

682
00:44:08,176 --> 00:44:10,339
Your own imagination is enough.

683
00:44:10,339 --> 00:44:12,321
That's more manageable.

684
00:44:12,321 --> 00:44:13,102
Right.

685
00:44:13,102 --> 00:44:14,644
We have control over that.

686
00:44:14,644 --> 00:44:17,748
Now, I know people in aerospace engineering have a lot

687
00:44:17,748 --> 00:44:22,473
of different interests, but I think the fact that you're a painter makes you unique in my book.

688
00:44:22,473 --> 00:44:23,534
What do you enjoy painting?

689
00:44:23,534 --> 00:44:26,438
Oh, like there are two types.

690
00:44:26,438 --> 00:44:32,165
I like basically drawing portraits and also natural sceneries.

691
00:44:33,186 --> 00:44:37,030
Yeah, I mean, I just like, all the time looking for sunset pictures.

692
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:38,973
I just like throwing that, yeah.

693
00:44:38,973 --> 00:44:43,080
I feel like that's kind of my way to get away from research.

694
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:47,247
So that's very like soothing and calming.

695
00:44:47,247 --> 00:44:50,652
I think your coping skills are... I'm going to take notes.

696
00:44:51,454 --> 00:44:57,263
As a native of Morocco, you note that one of your favorite Moroccan dishes is chicken pastilla.

697
00:44:57,263 --> 00:45:00,470
Could you please explain what that is?

698
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:05,935
So it is made of chicken with some Moroccan spices.

699
00:45:05,935 --> 00:45:13,101
It has cinnamon and with the crispy phyllo dough.

700
00:45:13,101 --> 00:45:15,784
It is like a mixture of sweet and salty.

701
00:45:15,784 --> 00:45:18,586
I don't know if anyone here has ever visited Morocco.

702
00:45:18,586 --> 00:45:20,868
Oh, there are a few people.

703
00:45:20,868 --> 00:45:22,190
OK, that's amazing.

704
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:28,115
If you ever have the chance to go to Morocco, I really recommend trying Moroccan pastillas.

705
00:45:28,115 --> 00:45:28,695
They're delicious.

706
00:45:28,695 --> 00:45:30,117
Do you make chicken pastillas?

707
00:45:30,117 --> 00:45:30,457
No.

708
00:45:30,457 --> 00:45:37,590
So we don't ordinarily do product placements, but have

709
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:41,257
you found any good Moroccan food in Boulder, Denver?

710
00:45:41,257 --> 00:45:42,319
Unfortunately, no.

711
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:46,186
I'm still looking.

712
00:45:46,186 --> 00:45:48,951
If any Moroccan is interested in opening a Moroccan restaurant,

713
00:45:48,951 --> 00:45:50,834
I guess that would be great, like business.

714
00:45:52,197 --> 00:45:53,038
Thank you, Marwa.

715
00:45:53,038 --> 00:45:54,000
Oh, thank you.

716
00:46:01,068 --> 00:46:08,656
Next up, we have Anna Deese, PhD candidate in Educational Foundations, Policy and Practice.

717
00:46:08,656 --> 00:46:11,760
The title of their presentation is, When Students and

718
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,665
School Voters Differ, The Promise and Peril of Local Control.

719
00:46:16,665 --> 00:46:21,350
Hi, everyone.

720
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:26,482
My name is Anna, and I study the local democratic control of American schools.

721
00:46:26,482 --> 00:46:31,090
Local control means that resident citizens of an area can

722
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:34,156
vote on things like increasing taxes to support their

723
00:46:34,156 --> 00:46:40,708
schools, or electing school board representatives who can create and oversee district policies.

724
00:46:41,509 --> 00:46:46,498
Most of the time, local control is a good thing for both education and democracy.

725
00:46:47,423 --> 00:46:51,471
But it can be problematic, and a really awful example

726
00:46:51,471 --> 00:46:56,059
out of East Ramapo, New York is what inspired my research.

727
00:46:56,059 --> 00:47:00,027
There, the local schools served mostly black and Latino

728
00:47:00,027 --> 00:47:03,994
students, but the elected school board was dominated by

729
00:47:03,994 --> 00:47:09,023
white officials whose own children attended private religious schools.

730
00:47:09,023 --> 00:47:16,269
These white officials regularly enacted policies that hurt the education of the students of color,

731
00:47:16,269 --> 00:47:18,611
all so that the white community could save money on

732
00:47:18,611 --> 00:47:22,635
taxes and direct those savings back to the private schools.

733
00:47:23,596 --> 00:47:27,680
What's worse is the legal voter suppression techniques were

734
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:34,846
used to prevent candidates of color from earning seats on the school board to reverse those policies.

735
00:47:35,887 --> 00:47:38,723
This is a story not from the 1950s,

736
00:47:38,723 --> 00:47:40,125
but within the last decade.

737
00:47:41,306 --> 00:47:45,771
The goal of my research is to identify school

738
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:51,057
districts where local control might be harming students in racialized ways.

739
00:47:52,098 --> 00:47:56,143
If these districts can be identified, then protections within

740
00:47:56,143 --> 00:48:00,588
the Voting Rights Act could be used to help fix things.

741
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:03,327
To do this,

742
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,610
To find my problematic districts, I first do a very

743
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:12,235
technical squishing of lots of maps and demographic data in

744
00:48:12,235 --> 00:48:16,298
order to calculate what I call the representation index.

745
00:48:16,298 --> 00:48:18,960
My index is a measure of how different the race and

746
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,804
ethnicity of the eligible voters in an area are from the

747
00:48:22,804 --> 00:48:25,346
race and ethnicity of the students using the schools.

748
00:48:26,247 --> 00:48:29,609
Districts with large differences, districts like those up

749
00:48:29,609 --> 00:48:33,061
there in red, districts like East Ramapo,

750
00:48:33,061 --> 00:48:36,525
are places where local advocates might wanna step up

751
00:48:36,525 --> 00:48:40,991
their monitoring or where the Voting Rights Act could be used to fix harms.

752
00:48:42,393 --> 00:48:46,698
Of course, it would be way better if no harm came to students in the first place.

753
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,764
So in addition to calculating my index, I add in a

754
00:48:51,764 --> 00:48:55,829
variety of other measures that are related to education

755
00:48:55,829 --> 00:49:01,630
policies that previous research suggests might have a racialized impact.

756
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:06,637
This way, local decision makers can use my index,

757
00:49:06,637 --> 00:49:09,601
those measures, and their knowledge of what's happening on

758
00:49:09,601 --> 00:49:12,345
the ground to make more equity-oriented decisions.

759
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:17,392
Local control can be a good thing, but hasn't served communities of color well.

760
00:49:17,392 --> 00:49:18,554
I want to fix that.

761
00:49:18,554 --> 00:49:18,935
Thank you.

762
00:49:24,983 --> 00:49:27,267
Hi, Bud.

763
00:49:27,267 --> 00:49:30,200
So before coming to CU Boulder,

764
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,084
Anna had a lot of very different types of jobs.

765
00:49:34,084 --> 00:49:36,326
Would you tell us about some of those?

766
00:49:36,326 --> 00:49:40,610
I can see my cohort here from the School of Ed

767
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:45,055
all laughing because they are well aware of how weird my background is.

768
00:49:45,055 --> 00:49:47,577
So I was a corporate consultant.

769
00:49:47,577 --> 00:49:49,159
I was in the military.

770
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:54,784
I've been a teacher in both inner city and in rural settings.

771
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,766
I've been an elected school board member.

772
00:49:56,766 --> 00:49:59,869
I don't know what else I have on there.

773
00:50:00,777 --> 00:50:02,319
You have a licensure.

774
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,483
Oh, I have my principal's licensure.

775
00:50:04,483 --> 00:50:06,065
Yeah, yeah.

776
00:50:06,065 --> 00:50:08,469
I have a lot of things.

777
00:50:08,469 --> 00:50:14,398
So do you have a story from your experience teaching in Oregon and Chicago?

778
00:50:14,398 --> 00:50:19,606
Um, I mean, there's lots of, there are lots of stories.

779
00:50:19,606 --> 00:50:22,210
I guess one of my favorites was I taught anatomy and

780
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:26,377
physiology and I always wanted to start by having, um,

781
00:50:26,377 --> 00:50:29,704
My students do a dissection right away.

782
00:50:29,704 --> 00:50:30,966
And we didn't have a lot of money.

783
00:50:30,966 --> 00:50:32,650
Schools need more money, y'all.

784
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:33,491
Vote for those things.

785
00:50:35,455 --> 00:50:39,142
So I bought the cheapest things I could, which were these sharks.

786
00:50:40,104 --> 00:50:44,922
And they were messed up when they were putting in all the

787
00:50:44,922 --> 00:50:46,144
stuff to preserve them.

788
00:50:46,965 --> 00:50:53,213
And so, like, you just, like, find random blobs of, like, whatever dye they were using.

789
00:50:53,213 --> 00:51:00,222
And my kids thought it was great, so I had them write up practice, like, forensic files and stuff.

790
00:51:00,222 --> 00:51:04,648
But, yeah, it was really weird, but it was better than the pickles we did the year before.

791
00:51:04,648 --> 00:51:04,888
So.

792
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:07,712
Messed up sharks to pickles.

793
00:51:07,712 --> 00:51:08,833
Yeah.

794
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:09,935
Only in public school.

795
00:51:09,935 --> 00:51:10,724
Yes.

796
00:51:10,724 --> 00:51:14,227
So it sounds like your experience as an elected school

797
00:51:14,227 --> 00:51:19,051
board member in Montana was kind of a direct path to your dissertation research.

798
00:51:19,051 --> 00:51:19,952
Definitely.

799
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:23,736
Because you realize when you're an elected member, you do

800
00:51:23,736 --> 00:51:26,999
have so much control, so much power, so much potential.

801
00:51:27,799 --> 00:51:30,682
But also in a lot of ways, you don't.

802
00:51:30,682 --> 00:51:33,244
And you're really shaped by so many other things.

803
00:51:33,244 --> 00:51:39,730
And so that's been a question that's been going through my mind for the last many years.

804
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:40,711
Sorry to my advisors.

805
00:51:40,711 --> 00:51:42,293
Getting out of here soon, though.

806
00:51:42,293 --> 00:51:45,657
No, no, no, no dates, no dates.

807
00:51:45,657 --> 00:51:48,501
Like Marwa, you enjoy reading as an escape.

808
00:51:48,501 --> 00:51:49,141
I do.

809
00:51:49,141 --> 00:51:50,944
What types of books do you read?

810
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:55,529
I read really, like, junky crime novels, like the ones

811
00:51:55,529 --> 00:52:01,917
that you will buy at the airport, and you're like, why are there 15 books by this person right here?

812
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:03,700
Like, this can't be that good.

813
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:06,192
But I will go through them like nothing else.

814
00:52:06,192 --> 00:52:08,615
So do you have any titles or authors you'd recommend?

815
00:52:08,615 --> 00:52:10,277
No, because that would be embarrassing.

816
00:52:10,277 --> 00:52:11,378
No.

817
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,780
No.

818
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,382
No one's taking any notes.

819
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:15,663
And yeah, we're safe.

820
00:52:15,663 --> 00:52:19,428
You can come look at my Libby later on while we're eating.

821
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:20,529
That's it.

822
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:25,875
So in addition to your work at CU as a graduate student, you're also a mom.

823
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:26,416
Yes.

824
00:52:26,416 --> 00:52:29,800
So did you practice your 3MT presentation to your son?

825
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,601
He does.

826
00:52:30,601 --> 00:52:32,503
Did I practice my speech to you?

827
00:52:33,648 --> 00:52:36,471
Yes.

828
00:52:36,471 --> 00:52:41,377
So, Des, did you have any recommendations for your mom?

829
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:45,822
Good answer.

830
00:52:45,822 --> 00:52:46,443
Thank you, Anna.

831
00:52:46,443 --> 00:52:47,584
Thank you so much.

832
00:52:54,673 --> 00:53:00,530
Next up, we have Hunter Ray, PhD candidate in aerospace engineering.

833
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:07,884
The title of their presentation is Drones to the Rescue, from Tools to Teammates in Public Safety.

834
00:53:15,979 --> 00:53:18,524
As a first responder, having the right tools and the

835
00:53:18,524 --> 00:53:22,771
right teammates is what's going to make the difference when trying to save your life.

836
00:53:22,771 --> 00:53:25,754
One of the best tools we can carry is a drone,

837
00:53:25,754 --> 00:53:28,837
because they can quickly cover large areas, and they keep my

838
00:53:28,837 --> 00:53:31,600
teammates and I safe and aware of changing situations.

839
00:53:32,802 --> 00:53:35,745
Imagine 14-year-old Taylor went for a walk a few hours

840
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:40,710
ago that hasn't come back yet, but it's getting dark and there's a storm coming.

841
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:47,155
When you call 911, I might be one of the first responders to arrive to help you find your child.

842
00:53:47,155 --> 00:53:50,540
But even though we constantly train for this exact scenario,

843
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:53,405
it still takes two to three people to manage a single drone.

844
00:53:54,727 --> 00:53:56,670
And that's because as a pilot, I need to be

845
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:00,275
laser-focused on flying the drone around trees and buildings, so

846
00:54:00,275 --> 00:54:03,901
I need my teammates' help in looking at the video and talking on the radio.

847
00:54:04,943 --> 00:54:09,169
All this people adds complexity, which adds training, so that

848
00:54:09,169 --> 00:54:13,336
when the time comes, we know that we can find Taylor.

849
00:54:13,336 --> 00:54:15,421
And so that's where my research comes in.

850
00:54:15,421 --> 00:54:18,747
I aim to turn drones from simply tools into teammates

851
00:54:18,747 --> 00:54:21,813
by helping them understand the context of the mission and giving

852
00:54:21,813 --> 00:54:25,319
them the ability to give feedback to make sure those goals are aligned.

853
00:54:26,562 --> 00:54:30,229
So the first step towards that is helping the drone understand context.

854
00:54:30,229 --> 00:54:34,557
Instead of flying the drone left and right and up, I want to be able to say, go over there.

855
00:54:35,558 --> 00:54:38,003
Search up the stream to the trail that leads to the farm.

856
00:54:39,097 --> 00:54:41,980
And so to do that, I built a user interface and

857
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:47,645
wrote some software that provided a foundation for helping the drone understand that mission context.

858
00:54:48,566 --> 00:54:50,928
But when we tested it, something wasn't quite right.

859
00:54:50,928 --> 00:54:53,191
Even though we could give the drone a lot of

860
00:54:53,191 --> 00:54:58,175
information, its goals weren't always aligned with their pilot.

861
00:54:58,175 --> 00:54:59,997
And so what we thought we needed, we needed a way of

862
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:03,621
giving feedback for the drone to show what it thought it understood.

863
00:55:03,621 --> 00:55:07,868
And to test that idea, we ran a simulated experiment.

864
00:55:07,868 --> 00:55:13,236
where we see how pilots worked with drones, and the drone actually gave feedback.

865
00:55:13,236 --> 00:55:15,980
In this case, it would simply ask a question as to

866
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,185
whether they thought the victim was near a certain landmark.

867
00:55:19,185 --> 00:55:19,786
And this worked.

868
00:55:20,687 --> 00:55:26,315
Not only did the team find more missing people, the pilots actually trusted the robot more.

869
00:55:27,197 --> 00:55:29,740
And that's because whereas tools do exactly what you

870
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:35,290
do, sometimes they're detriment, a teammate works with you to accomplish a shared task.

871
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:39,175
And adding feedback fundamentally changes this dynamic.

872
00:55:39,175 --> 00:55:41,457
This reduces the number of people we need per

873
00:55:41,457 --> 00:55:45,382
aircraft, magnifying the impact of the team, simplifying our

874
00:55:45,382 --> 00:55:49,106
operations, and reducing the training time we need.

875
00:55:49,106 --> 00:55:53,692
All to make sure that when the time comes, we can find Taylor.

876
00:55:53,692 --> 00:55:55,774
So whether we're fighting fire, looking for a

877
00:55:55,774 --> 00:55:59,999
missing person, recovering after disaster, this research gives

878
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,898
first responders a safe and reliable teammate.

879
00:56:02,898 --> 00:56:06,262
that works with them to support and protect their communities.

880
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:09,826
So that in these matters of life and death, like the

881
00:56:09,826 --> 00:56:13,871
search for Taylor, you know that these robots will have your back.

882
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:14,211
Thank you.

883
00:56:20,038 --> 00:56:20,679
Thanks, Hunter.

884
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:24,883
So some of your colleagues have shared with us the types

885
00:56:24,883 --> 00:56:29,240
of food they enjoy, and I understand you have a go-to food.

886
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,964
I think cheese is one of the best foods in the world.

887
00:56:33,326 --> 00:56:36,430
It comes in different flavors, shapes, sizes, smells.

888
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,513
You know, you really can never get bored.

889
00:56:38,513 --> 00:56:41,277
So do you have like a top three?

890
00:56:41,277 --> 00:56:46,966
Well, I did grow up in France, and they have this great cheese that translates to Golden Mountain.

891
00:56:46,966 --> 00:56:53,033
And it's so creamy, it smells like a barnyard, but it's a real symphony in your mouth.

892
00:56:53,033 --> 00:56:54,536
We'll let it go there.

893
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:57,804
Although, have you talked to Anna Turner about her mac and cheese?

894
00:56:57,804 --> 00:57:00,991
Because she, I think, might be open to cheese recommendations.

895
00:57:00,991 --> 00:57:02,314
Yeah, that might be a bit much.

896
00:57:05,161 --> 00:57:06,304
So yeah, we'll let that one go.

897
00:57:06,304 --> 00:57:09,992
Like Casey, you also enjoy skiing.

898
00:57:09,992 --> 00:57:11,798
What kind of skiing do you do?

899
00:57:11,798 --> 00:57:13,140
You can always find me in the trees.

900
00:57:13,941 --> 00:57:16,984
I love flying through the trees on a nice day.

901
00:57:18,106 --> 00:57:19,467
Maybe to my detriment sometimes.

902
00:57:20,348 --> 00:57:22,912
But every, every time down the trees you're always exploring

903
00:57:22,912 --> 00:57:27,377
a new way, and you're, you're really enjoying yourself in nature, and I really love that.

904
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:28,899
Do you have any go-to?

905
00:57:28,899 --> 00:57:30,161
Well, steamboat's great.

906
00:57:30,161 --> 00:57:34,946
I mean, flying through the aspens and, and those trees out there is really something special.

907
00:57:34,946 --> 00:57:35,447
Wow.

908
00:57:35,447 --> 00:57:36,228
Okay.

909
00:57:36,228 --> 00:57:37,870
I'll let you do that.

910
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:42,537
Before coming to see you, Boulder, Hunter also had quite a range of jobs that you did.

911
00:57:42,537 --> 00:57:44,660
Can you tell us about some of them?

912
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:48,545
Yeah, so I worked as an aerospace engineer building spacecraft systems.

913
00:57:48,545 --> 00:57:54,573
So I was working on moon landers and instruments that would be going across the solar system.

914
00:57:54,573 --> 00:57:58,559
And that was a really exciting place to be as a young engineer.

915
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:01,804
But I got really interested in how people play a part,

916
00:58:01,804 --> 00:58:04,267
and that's where I decided to come here and do my

917
00:58:04,267 --> 00:58:09,674
PhD, understanding how people and machines can really work together in a better way.

918
00:58:09,674 --> 00:58:12,438
And how long have you been a first responder?

919
00:58:12,438 --> 00:58:15,823
Just four years now, and that's been a really rewarding experience.

920
00:58:15,823 --> 00:58:19,348
You know, the people that we work with and the people

921
00:58:19,348 --> 00:58:24,135
that we show up to, we're often engaging with them on their very worst day, right?

922
00:58:24,135 --> 00:58:26,234
It's oftentimes the worst day of their lives.

923
00:58:26,234 --> 00:58:30,362
So it's a real honor to be able to help them in that situation.

924
00:58:30,362 --> 00:58:33,047
But there's also a huge amount of responsibility that comes

925
00:58:33,047 --> 00:58:37,054
from that and actually being able to help them execute the mission with your team.

926
00:58:37,054 --> 00:58:38,116
Absolutely.

927
00:58:38,116 --> 00:58:38,777
That's amazing.

928
00:58:39,919 --> 00:58:43,366
So you mentioned spending time in France as a youngster.

929
00:58:43,366 --> 00:58:44,708
You also were in Japan.

930
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:45,630
That's right.

931
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:46,872
Very lucky.

932
00:58:46,872 --> 00:58:50,376
So were you as tall then as you are now?

933
00:58:50,376 --> 00:58:51,338
I sure was.

934
00:58:51,338 --> 00:58:57,045
And I remember they have these signs in the subways that stop at six feet.

935
00:58:57,045 --> 00:58:59,608
And I remember when I was younger, I started hitting

936
00:58:59,608 --> 00:59:02,551
my head on those advertisements in the subway.

937
00:59:02,551 --> 00:59:04,714
And that's when I realized I was really tall.

938
00:59:05,795 --> 00:59:06,476
Thank you, Hunter.

939
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:07,918
Thanks, bud.

940
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:21,650
Next up, we have Aoife Henry, PhD candidate in electrical computer and energy engineering.

941
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:27,197
The title of their presentation is, directing wind turbines with foresight.

942
00:59:27,197 --> 00:59:30,761
The shepherd and the sheep dog find a crystal ball.

943
00:59:32,684 --> 00:59:35,587
In my research, I am a shepherd of wind turbines.

944
00:59:35,587 --> 00:59:37,370
You see, wind turbines are like sheep.

945
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:40,193
They're sturdy, they're obedient, but they're also kind of

946
00:59:40,193 --> 00:59:44,146
simple creatures and they don't know how to handle themselves for the good of the group.

947
00:59:44,146 --> 00:59:49,113
When the wind rolls in they need to be firmly instructed which way to face as conditions change.

948
00:59:49,113 --> 00:59:52,598
Their default behaviour is to all very slowly rotate to face

949
00:59:52,598 --> 00:59:56,363
the wind and to greasily lap up as much of its energy as they can.

950
00:59:56,363 --> 01:00:00,168
But what the turbines don't know is that by doing this they're blocking the wind

951
01:00:00,168 --> 01:00:02,451
for their less fortunate friends in the middle and at the

952
01:00:02,451 --> 01:00:06,455
back of the pack and that the entire flock is producing less energy overall.

953
01:00:06,455 --> 01:00:08,418
They also don't know that by the time they have

954
01:00:08,418 --> 01:00:13,206
finally rotated to face the wind they measured, the wind direction has changed anyway.

955
01:00:13,206 --> 01:00:14,808
Now, I'm a busy shepherd.

956
01:00:14,808 --> 01:00:17,652
I don't have time to tell these turbines what to do every second of every day.

957
01:00:17,652 --> 01:00:20,677
Instead, I design a wind farm controller.

958
01:00:20,677 --> 01:00:22,760
This is like a sheepdog who's been trained to read

959
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,785
the situation and to direct the turbines accordingly.

960
01:00:25,785 --> 01:00:28,570
This sheepdog looks at the wind speed and direction measurements,

961
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:33,758
and it barks at the turbines to rotate in a way that produces the most overall wind farm power.

962
01:00:33,758 --> 01:00:35,941
The best research has come up with so far is to tell

963
01:00:35,941 --> 01:00:38,925
the turbines at the front and the middle to face the wind at an angle.

964
01:00:38,925 --> 01:00:40,707
This leaves more wind energy for their pals at the

965
01:00:40,707 --> 01:00:45,674
back, achieving 10% more overall power in simulations.

966
01:00:45,674 --> 01:00:50,861
The problem is that this result dwindles to 1% in real wind farms.

967
01:00:50,861 --> 01:00:56,303
The focus of my work is to design a wind farm controller that can adapt to real wind conditions.

968
01:00:56,303 --> 01:00:58,245
So what's wrong with this existing controller?

969
01:00:58,245 --> 01:01:02,209
This sheepdog, he's a good boy, but the wind is disorderly and very unpredictable.

970
01:01:02,209 --> 01:01:06,453
This sheepdog doesn't foresee how the wind will behave in the future.

971
01:01:06,453 --> 01:01:09,095
It doesn't understand how much weaker, more turbulent, and

972
01:01:09,095 --> 01:01:13,199
diverted the wind becomes as it blows in and around the turbines.

973
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:15,922
In simulations, the wind is well behaved, but out in the

974
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,864
Wild West of Texas, where most of the U.S.'

975
01:01:17,864 --> 01:01:19,806
's wind farms are, it's a different story.

976
01:01:20,687 --> 01:01:22,969
My thesis is to create a crystal ball.

977
01:01:22,969 --> 01:01:24,485
We'll call it a forecaster.

978
01:01:24,485 --> 01:01:26,968
that can make predictions about how the wind will change

979
01:01:26,968 --> 01:01:30,412
in the coming minutes once it's been agitated by the turbines.

980
01:01:30,412 --> 01:01:34,537
I've trained a computer program to decrypt months' worth of wind farm data

981
01:01:34,537 --> 01:01:37,060
and to learn the relationships between the wind speed

982
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:40,204
and direction, turbine power, and rotation measurements over time.

983
01:01:41,045 --> 01:01:44,870
I've upgraded the existing sheepdog with this forecaster so

984
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:46,852
he can direct the turbines with foresight.

985
01:01:47,733 --> 01:01:51,357
My sheepdog can start their sheepishly slow rotation early

986
01:01:51,357 --> 01:01:55,096
so that their positioning is just right for the winds they will see in the future.

987
01:01:55,096 --> 01:02:00,343
Finally, I will fine-tune its training with live feedback from the Windfarm ex-operating app,

988
01:02:00,343 --> 01:02:04,849
so that both the forecaster's predictions and the controller's instructions get better and better.

989
01:02:05,951 --> 01:02:10,757
By equipping a Windfarm controller with a forecaster, I have trained a very clever sheepdog.

990
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:15,404
This could enable real Windfarms to reclaim the 10% extra

991
01:02:15,404 --> 01:02:19,092
energy yield lost on the path from academia to industry.

992
01:02:19,092 --> 01:02:21,816
reducing the cost of green energy by a dollar for

993
01:02:21,816 --> 01:02:27,325
every ten, and hopefully, kicking fossil fuels to the curb, no matter how the wind blows.

994
01:02:27,325 --> 01:02:33,455
Thank you.

995
01:02:33,455 --> 01:02:34,136
Thank you, Ethan.

996
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:39,164
So, I understand that you know two languages that

997
01:02:39,164 --> 01:02:44,843
are commonly considered to be endangered languages, Irish Gaelic and Scots.

998
01:02:44,843 --> 01:02:46,245
That's right.

999
01:02:46,245 --> 01:02:47,306
How did that come to be?

1000
01:02:48,387 --> 01:02:49,548
I was born in Scotland.

1001
01:02:49,548 --> 01:02:52,732
I usually tell people I'm Irish because that's my dominating accent at the moment.

1002
01:02:52,732 --> 01:02:55,114
We'll see how that changes in the next few years.

1003
01:02:55,114 --> 01:02:56,776
But I was born in Scotland.

1004
01:02:56,776 --> 01:03:00,600
My dad is Irish but was an enthusiast for dead languages.

1005
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:05,786
So he sent me to one of very few Scots-Galic speaking schools.

1006
01:03:05,786 --> 01:03:08,228
And we were a half and half household.

1007
01:03:09,049 --> 01:03:12,593
And we spoke Irish at home and then Scots-Galic at school.

1008
01:03:12,593 --> 01:03:12,653
Wow.

1009
01:03:12,653 --> 01:03:18,061
So I understand you and your father can do something when you're around other people.

1010
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:18,421
Sure.

1011
01:03:18,421 --> 01:03:20,945
Yeah, it's kind of a secret language at this point.

1012
01:03:20,945 --> 01:03:23,748
And actually, when I was in undergrad, I also lived in

1013
01:03:23,748 --> 01:03:28,876
a house, a grand house where they pay you to live there as long as you spoke Irish with each other.

1014
01:03:28,876 --> 01:03:31,459
But it appeared quite culty from the outside because we

1015
01:03:31,459 --> 01:03:34,223
all wore matching hoodies and spoke the secret language to one another.

1016
01:03:36,667 --> 01:03:38,009
But it wasn't a cult.

1017
01:03:38,009 --> 01:03:39,571
Yeah, not a cult.

1018
01:03:39,571 --> 01:03:42,134
So I understand that you try to run most days.

1019
01:03:42,134 --> 01:03:44,056
I do, yeah.

1020
01:03:44,056 --> 01:03:44,937
And where do you like to run?

1021
01:03:45,899 --> 01:03:47,200
I'm kind of boring at the moment.

1022
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,382
I'm trying to graduate soon.

1023
01:03:48,382 --> 01:03:51,766
So I try to use my brain as little as possible outside of work.

1024
01:03:51,766 --> 01:03:53,028
So the less turns, the better.

1025
01:03:53,028 --> 01:03:55,130
If I could run in a straight line and come back, I would.

1026
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:59,115
But usually routes around the boulder trails.

1027
01:03:59,115 --> 01:04:01,338
No judgment.

1028
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:04,201
So were you a big runner before you came to Boulder?

1029
01:04:04,201 --> 01:04:06,403
Yeah, I used to be more competitive.

1030
01:04:06,403 --> 01:04:08,806
I used to do a lot of trail marathons but I've pulled

1031
01:04:08,806 --> 01:04:11,628
back from that a little bit now because it's not a reasonable

1032
01:04:11,628 --> 01:04:14,912
distance to run and I don't recommend it to anyone.

1033
01:04:14,912 --> 01:04:17,434
So do you have a temperature cutoff that you won't run below?

1034
01:04:17,434 --> 01:04:21,659
I actually relate a lot to Anna from earlier because I did run the ice

1035
01:04:21,659 --> 01:04:24,962
and suffered a very unusual injury for a runner in that I

1036
01:04:24,962 --> 01:04:28,085
tore two muscles in my arm a month ago from slipping on ice.

1037
01:04:28,085 --> 01:04:30,888
Maybe a treadmill would be a safer bet.

1038
01:04:30,888 --> 01:04:33,190
When it's cold and icy, yeah.

1039
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:38,515
So in addition to your research on winter blinds and coding, you also do stand-up comedy.

1040
01:04:39,496 --> 01:04:40,277
When did that start?

1041
01:04:41,258 --> 01:04:47,043
It had been something I'd wanted to do for a long time, and then my strategy, I was so nervous.

1042
01:04:47,043 --> 01:04:49,185
My strategy was to go to a very small place, which was

1043
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:55,051
the Trident, where they do it once a month, and to kind of dominate the space with my friends.

1044
01:04:55,051 --> 01:04:58,078
I duped about 11 people into going there.

1045
01:04:58,078 --> 01:04:59,642
There was only about 25 people there.

1046
01:05:00,483 --> 01:05:02,167
So I thought I'd at least get 11 laughs.

1047
01:05:03,029 --> 01:05:04,793
And they're well-behaved friends.

1048
01:05:04,793 --> 01:05:07,840
So is there a joke that you'd like to try out on us?

1049
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:08,402
Different audience.

1050
01:05:10,286 --> 01:05:14,710
Safe, yeah.

1051
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:18,495
I understand that one of your favorite foods is wellness sushi.

1052
01:05:18,495 --> 01:05:21,440
In Denver, what is wellness sushi?

1053
01:05:22,481 --> 01:05:27,408
I'm ethically fussy in my diet, and it's an all vegan sushi place, which I love.

1054
01:05:27,408 --> 01:05:28,610
It's well worth the drive.

1055
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:30,773
And I've been on dates there.

1056
01:05:30,773 --> 01:05:31,855
I've taken friends there.

1057
01:05:31,855 --> 01:05:33,998
I've been there to celebrate things and grieve things.

1058
01:05:33,998 --> 01:05:35,941
So it's sushi for all occasions.

1059
01:05:35,941 --> 01:05:36,482
It's good.

1060
01:05:36,482 --> 01:05:37,203
Fabulous.

1061
01:05:37,203 --> 01:05:37,964
Thank you, Eva.

1062
01:05:37,964 --> 01:05:38,845
Thank you.

1063
01:05:45,322 --> 01:05:52,682
Next up, we have Heather Kinney Dudelo, PhD candidate in ecology and evolutionary biology.

1064
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:59,179
The title of their presentation is Feathered Flinges, the Dating Lives of Barn Swallows.

1065
01:06:02,011 --> 01:06:07,180
Finding a romantic partner is a big decision, and it's no easy task.

1066
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:11,427
You might turn to dating apps for help, but how do birds find a date?

1067
01:06:11,427 --> 01:06:14,352
Understanding the dating habits of birds can actually help

1068
01:06:14,352 --> 01:06:16,796
explain the amazing diversity of bird species.

1069
01:06:17,618 --> 01:06:20,623
Many birds use their colorful feathers to attract mates.

1070
01:06:20,623 --> 01:06:26,480
For example, in barn swallows, individuals with darker brown dress feathers are more attractive.

1071
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,184
traits that are favored for mating become common in

1072
01:06:29,184 --> 01:06:34,732
the population, and this helps explain why different bird species are different colors.

1073
01:06:34,732 --> 01:06:38,478
However, dating is about more than just good looks, right?

1074
01:06:38,478 --> 01:06:41,162
It also requires being in the right place at the

1075
01:06:41,162 --> 01:06:44,688
right time and forming a social bond with someone.

1076
01:06:44,688 --> 01:06:47,492
My research explores this in barn swallows by

1077
01:06:47,492 --> 01:06:54,340
asking how social interactions, movement patterns, and nest locations matter for mate choice.

1078
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:57,007
Barn swallows nest on barns and other human-made

1079
01:06:57,007 --> 01:07:00,416
structures which makes them accessible for research.

1080
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:03,264
Multiple barn swallows can nest together in the same barn,

1081
01:07:03,264 --> 01:07:05,329
which we can think of as a nest neighborhood.

1082
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:08,794
First, I used backpack tags like the one pictured on

1083
01:07:08,794 --> 01:07:13,761
the left to record social interactions of birds within a single neighborhood.

1084
01:07:13,761 --> 01:07:17,946
The tags detect which birds got close to each other and how long they spent together.

1085
01:07:17,946 --> 01:07:22,252
Using these data, I can find out how strong a social bond

1086
01:07:22,252 --> 01:07:26,892
needs to be in order for two birds to mate and produce offspring.

1087
01:07:26,892 --> 01:07:31,698
Next, I used backpack tags again to record GPS locations

1088
01:07:31,698 --> 01:07:35,522
to see if some birds fly farther in search of mates than others.

1089
01:07:35,522 --> 01:07:37,985
Think of your friend who sets their dating app's match

1090
01:07:37,985 --> 01:07:42,811
radius to 100 miles and the other friend who sets it to only five miles.

1091
01:07:42,811 --> 01:07:45,094
On the map, you can see that the female shown in

1092
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:49,019
purple covered a larger area than the female shown in black.

1093
01:07:49,019 --> 01:07:54,297
Females that flew farther were more likely to have babies with multiple males.

1094
01:07:54,297 --> 01:07:57,241
Finally, the nesting barns are often located close to

1095
01:07:57,241 --> 01:08:00,987
each other, and the combined nest neighborhoods form a sort of town.

1096
01:08:01,868 --> 01:08:04,271
I found that barn swallows are more likely to mate

1097
01:08:04,271 --> 01:08:08,077
with neighbors from the same barn than with birds from the barn down the road.

1098
01:08:08,077 --> 01:08:13,805
Instead of looking everywhere for Mr. Right, females often choose Mr. Right here.

1099
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:18,191
Studying the breeding biology of swallows can help

1100
01:08:18,191 --> 01:08:22,462
us improve conservation efforts for this declining group.

1101
01:08:22,462 --> 01:08:26,987
And more than that, understanding how social interactions, movement patterns,

1102
01:08:26,987 --> 01:08:30,611
and nest neighborhoods matter for barn swallows allows us

1103
01:08:30,611 --> 01:08:38,460
to explain how large scale patterns of plumage evolution emerge from the mate choices of individual birds.

1104
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:40,522
I hope the next time you're outside and you see a

1105
01:08:40,522 --> 01:08:44,006
bird, you take a moment to wonder about its social life.

1106
01:08:44,006 --> 01:08:45,528
Where does it go and who does it meet?

1107
01:08:45,528 --> 01:08:48,952
Dating is complex in the bird world too, and you might

1108
01:08:48,952 --> 01:08:52,263
have more in common with that bird than you ever imagined.

1109
01:08:52,263 --> 01:08:52,724
Thank you.

1110
01:08:59,852 --> 01:09:00,433
Thank you, Heather.

1111
01:09:01,494 --> 01:09:03,697
So like Casey, you enjoy hiking.

1112
01:09:04,978 --> 01:09:08,102
Do you have any trails that you would recommend when the weather warms up?

1113
01:09:09,303 --> 01:09:09,644
Yeah.

1114
01:09:09,644 --> 01:09:13,168
So I live in North Boulder, and so we're near Wonderland Lake.

1115
01:09:13,168 --> 01:09:19,938
And so we really like the trails around the lake and also up from Lee Hill.

1116
01:09:19,938 --> 01:09:21,180
How far up Lee Hill?

1117
01:09:22,341 --> 01:09:23,522
Not too far.

1118
01:09:23,522 --> 01:09:24,444
There's a trailhead.

1119
01:09:25,465 --> 01:09:26,726
Just a block in.

1120
01:09:26,726 --> 01:09:27,227
All right.

1121
01:09:27,227 --> 01:09:28,048
I haven't seen that one.

1122
01:09:28,048 --> 01:09:28,649
I was like, OK.

1123
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:32,394
So Marwa and Anna enjoy reading novels.

1124
01:09:32,394 --> 01:09:34,036
What sort of books do you enjoy reading?

1125
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:38,201
I enjoy sci-fi and fantasy novels.

1126
01:09:38,201 --> 01:09:41,585
But unlike Marwa, I like cozy fantasy.

1127
01:09:42,526 --> 01:09:50,009
So this is like a story where you might have an ogre, but they decide to open up a coffee shop.

1128
01:09:50,009 --> 01:09:53,374
Clearly, I need to read more.

1129
01:09:53,374 --> 01:09:56,378
Do you have any titles or authors you recommend?

1130
01:09:56,378 --> 01:10:00,203
The author I really like is Becky Chambers.

1131
01:10:00,203 --> 01:10:03,508
She has a book called The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet.

1132
01:10:03,508 --> 01:10:04,750
That's quite good.

1133
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:05,551
Great title.

1134
01:10:05,551 --> 01:10:07,013
I love that.

1135
01:10:07,013 --> 01:10:10,318
This afternoon, you've heard a lot of fantastic food

1136
01:10:10,318 --> 01:10:14,884
stories from our graduate students, things that keep them fueled and inspired.

1137
01:10:15,826 --> 01:10:18,173
What is your favorite food?

1138
01:10:18,173 --> 01:10:24,000
The meal that came to mind when I was answering these questions is I really love

1139
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,803
when I go back and stay with my parents in

1140
01:10:25,803 --> 01:10:30,829
Northern California to make like buttermilk waffles in the morning and

1141
01:10:30,829 --> 01:10:33,732
we have a big blueberry patch in our backyard so

1142
01:10:33,732 --> 01:10:41,001
putting fresh blueberries and my mom also grows strawberries and raspberries so just triple berry waffles.

1143
01:10:41,001 --> 01:10:43,084
And when will you be home this summer?

1144
01:10:45,005 --> 01:10:49,070
Because I think we'll all try to have a little look.

1145
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:50,893
Oh my gosh, that sounds amazing.

1146
01:10:52,354 --> 01:10:54,497
So in addition to your graduate work in ecology

1147
01:10:54,497 --> 01:10:59,924
and evolutionary biology, you have also undertaken to learn the language Telugu.

1148
01:10:59,924 --> 01:11:00,905
Yeah, Telugu.

1149
01:11:00,905 --> 01:11:04,510
Telugu, one of the 22 official languages in India.

1150
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:07,273
Is your husband able to join us this afternoon?

1151
01:11:07,273 --> 01:11:08,748
He is here, yes.

1152
01:11:08,748 --> 01:11:13,074
Well, keeping in mind that tomorrow is Valentine's Day, is

1153
01:11:13,074 --> 01:11:15,217
there anything you would like to say to your husband?

1154
01:11:16,879 --> 01:11:21,125
We're actually going to dinner tonight because he four years

1155
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:27,173
ago proposed to me on February 13th, and so we celebrate on the 13th now.

1156
01:11:28,175 --> 01:11:30,678
Oh, my.

1157
01:11:30,678 --> 01:11:32,220
You can't make these stories up.

1158
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:33,943
Thank you, Heather.

1159
01:11:33,943 --> 01:11:34,924
Thank you.

1160
01:11:40,895 --> 01:11:46,551
Let's give another huge round of applause to our ten amazing presenters.

1161
01:11:51,543 --> 01:11:56,833
What an incredible showcase of talent, research, and communication skills.

1162
01:11:56,833 --> 01:12:03,024
While our judges finalize their evaluations, it's your turn to make your decision.

1163
01:12:03,024 --> 01:12:06,130
The People's Choice Award is in your hands.

1164
01:12:07,111 --> 01:12:09,756
In just a not even a moment.

1165
01:12:09,756 --> 01:12:12,316
Right here is

1166
01:12:12,316 --> 01:12:16,602
You'll have exactly three minutes to cast your vote for

1167
01:12:16,602 --> 01:12:22,871
a presenter that you felt delivered the clearest, most engaging, and most compelling talk.

1168
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:26,336
To vote, simply scan the QR code on the projection screen.

1169
01:12:27,438 --> 01:12:32,044
And remember, each audience member only gets one vote.

1170
01:12:32,044 --> 01:12:34,328
This is not Louisiana.

1171
01:12:34,328 --> 01:12:36,731
You can't vote early and often.

1172
01:12:36,731 --> 01:12:38,053
So only one vote.

1173
01:12:39,265 --> 01:12:43,512
So we'll now take a short break while the judges compile their scores.

1174
01:12:43,512 --> 01:12:46,037
There will be refreshments available.

1175
01:12:46,037 --> 01:12:51,806
You feel free to chat with your fellow attendees, and we'll see you back here in about 15 minutes.

1176
01:12:51,806 --> 01:12:53,950
Thank you all so much for being here today.

1177
01:13:20,069 --> 01:13:22,733
Dear friends, we are back.

1178
01:13:22,733 --> 01:13:24,475
Please stay in line.

1179
01:13:24,475 --> 01:13:27,178
Please enjoy the beverages and great food.

1180
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:29,261
But we are back.

1181
01:13:30,202 --> 01:13:32,666
The Graduate School here at CU Boulder is home to

1182
01:13:32,666 --> 01:13:36,170
graduate students from around the world, each contributing

1183
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:40,175
their expertise, creativity, and dedication to research.

1184
01:13:40,175 --> 01:13:45,162
Today, we had the privilege to hear from 10 of these remarkable scholars.

1185
01:13:45,162 --> 01:13:51,372
Now, multiply that 10 by the brilliance you saw today by 545.

1186
01:13:51,372 --> 01:13:55,619
That gets us up to the 6,000 graduate students who

1187
01:13:55,619 --> 01:13:58,824
are currently enrolled here at CU Boulder to give you just

1188
01:13:58,824 --> 01:14:02,770
a glimpse of the talent within our graduate community.

1189
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:06,917
So once again, let's give a big round of applause to our 10 finalists.

1190
01:14:10,205 --> 01:14:12,608
Now it is my great pleasure to welcome back Dean of

1191
01:14:12,608 --> 01:14:17,375
the Graduate School, Scott Adler, and we will announce and celebrate our winners.

1192
01:14:18,657 --> 01:14:24,425
So first up, the People's Choice Award goes to, now everybody have to do a drum roll.

Each of you showcased not only the depth of your

1203
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:25,238
research, but also the power of making knowledge accessible and engaging.

1204
01:16:25,238 --> 01:16:31,586
A heartfelt thank you to our competitors, to our judges for their thoughtful evaluations,

1205
01:16:31,586 --> 01:16:34,509
and of course, to all of you, our audience,

1206
01:16:34,509 --> 01:16:39,715
