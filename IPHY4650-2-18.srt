1
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:06,581
you

2
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:46,765
All right.

3
00:02:48,676 --> 00:02:49,783
Welcome back, everyone.

4
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:52,800
We'll get started here.

5
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:05,255
I'm sure you are all very eager to get your lecture exam scores back.

6
00:03:06,317 --> 00:03:11,505
I am still waiting on those to get back to me, so as soon as I know, you'll know.

7
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:16,314
But that does remind me to make sure we're kind of

8
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:21,943
shifting a little bit of the attention to the next big assessment, which is what?

9
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,079
Yeah, the lab exam.

10
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,205
So you have the lab exam in a couple of weeks.

11
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:29,790
So make sure you're staying on top of that.

12
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,516
So this week would be lab five.

13
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:38,107
That'll be the last lab that you'll be responsible for for lab exam one.

14
00:03:38,107 --> 00:03:41,191
The nice thing is next week you'll have an entire lab

15
00:03:41,191 --> 00:03:45,777
section to go over any of the previous labs as well as lab five.

16
00:03:45,777 --> 00:03:48,700
You can work through some worksheets, maybe review the

17
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,145
quiz questions and anything that you've gotten wrong.

18
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:56,330
That way you have a better understanding of maybe what you need to focus on to study.

19
00:03:57,492 --> 00:04:03,539
And then obviously get through some of the calculations that you might not have understood.

20
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:04,621
Did you have a question?

21
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:04,941
Yeah.

22
00:04:09,477 --> 00:04:12,880
Yeah, because there won't be enough chairs in a lot

23
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,144
of the other sections, we're hoping that you go to your signed section.

24
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:19,586
But again, if it's like if something comes up and you

25
00:04:19,586 --> 00:04:24,110
really can't go, then maybe you can reach out to see if they have some room in the other section.

26
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,113
But one of the other big things is your TA is going

27
00:04:28,113 --> 00:04:33,217
to hand back your worksheet as well as your old quizzes that you can review.

28
00:04:33,217 --> 00:04:36,700
So it works out a little bit better for everyone if you can.

29
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,322
But we understand that things come up.

30
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:38,722
Yeah.

31
00:04:38,722 --> 00:04:39,845
Yeah, thanks for asking, though.

32
00:04:43,353 --> 00:04:49,909
I'll have some more details next week on maybe what you should be looking for on the lab exam.

33
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:52,275
But for now, are there any broad questions?

34
00:04:56,204 --> 00:04:58,047
Okay, very good.

35
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:04,837
So we are starting on the new unit, so this will be the second unit for your second lecture exam.

36
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:13,906
The exams are not cumulative, but you could imagine that if you don't really understand

37
00:05:13,906 --> 00:05:18,213
energy production from a certain pathway that might hinder

38
00:05:18,213 --> 00:05:21,538
your ability to understand some of these upcoming concepts.

39
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:27,126
So no, I will not directly ask you on, say, chapters three and four lecture slides,

40
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:31,874
but if we're using some of that base fundamental knowledge

41
00:05:33,155 --> 00:05:42,442
to go over something in the skeletal muscle, it might be good to make sure you understand those concepts.

42
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,968
Exam two, we're gonna start with skeletal muscle.

43
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:51,277
We're gonna go through the structure as well as function and how it applies to exercise.

44
00:05:56,345 --> 00:05:58,088
Okay, so.

45
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:01,883
Structure and function is where we're gonna start.

46
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:04,268
Just like I mentioned, we'll go through muscle

47
00:06:04,268 --> 00:06:08,617
actions, neuromuscular junction, and muscular contraction.

48
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:14,108
We'll get into the oh-so-popular exercise-associated muscle cramp

49
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:16,773
topic, so that'll be kind of interesting.

50
00:06:16,773 --> 00:06:20,140
We'll briefly go through muscle fiber types and the different.

51
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:26,889
the different types of muscle fibers as well as how we actually get to fiber typing.

52
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:30,994
So the different procedures in typing muscle fibers.

53
00:06:30,994 --> 00:06:33,277
Force regulation in muscle.

54
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:37,283
And then another really popular topic with muscle soreness,

55
00:06:37,283 --> 00:06:43,210
which I think you will probably have an idea where I'm going with that already.

56
00:06:44,492 --> 00:06:49,759
So we'll just start with an easy question here just to get people going.

57
00:06:53,553 --> 00:06:55,329
Muscle weighs more than fat.

58
00:06:56,297 --> 00:06:57,387
True or false?

59
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:45,199
Okay, so we'll take a couple more seconds with this one.

60
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:49,506
If you need a little bit more time, let me know.

61
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:51,910
Yeah, no worries, no rush.

62
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,174
We'll take about another 30 seconds.

63
00:07:54,174 --> 00:08:00,665
I'll check back in in 30 seconds here.

64
00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:06,675
It's just a question to get you thinking about these different tissues.

65
00:08:21,674 --> 00:08:24,197
Okay, does anyone need a little bit more time getting set up?

66
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:30,565
Okay, I'll close this down here in five seconds.

67
00:08:33,588 --> 00:08:36,091
Three, two, one.

68
00:08:40,156 --> 00:08:46,344
Okay, most of you are answering true, but like most

69
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:49,113
of these type of questions that I've shown you,

70
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:50,195
It depends, right?

71
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:54,422
So what's a better way that I could have worded this question?

72
00:08:56,366 --> 00:09:00,293
Yeah, so which one is more dense?

73
00:09:00,293 --> 00:09:03,579
That would probably be the better way to word this, but it

74
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:07,507
was just to get you to think about this concept that

75
00:09:07,507 --> 00:09:12,318
Well, one pound of fat is the same thing as one pound of muscle.

76
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:17,569
The largest difference between these two tissues would be that

77
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:21,999
muscle is more dense and takes up less space.

78
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:27,591
If something's more dense for the same amount of weight, it just takes space.

79
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:33,442
So here on the left, this is always a fun picture to

80
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:38,215
look at, but if this is five pounds of fat, this would be five pounds of muscle.

81
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:44,010
Muscle.

82
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:50,534
weighs or takes up a large proportion of our total body weight.

83
00:09:50,534 --> 00:09:54,780
Depending on each individual, it is different, but on average,

84
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,946
we're looking at more than 40 to 50% of your total body weight.

85
00:09:59,848 --> 00:10:03,033
And there are over 600 skeletal muscles in the body.

86
00:10:03,974 --> 00:10:06,998
Luckily, you do not need to worry about those

87
00:10:06,998 --> 00:10:11,986
600 muscles because you've already taken anatomy, meaning you've already been tested on that, right?

88
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,149
I'm not gonna test you on all 600 here.

89
00:10:15,395 --> 00:10:19,419
But let's look at the basic structure and function.

90
00:10:21,201 --> 00:10:27,587
So anytime we start reviewing some of these concepts, remember that they are review.

91
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:31,411
You shouldn't spend a lot of time on them, but you should just know the basic understanding of it.

92
00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:37,157
So skeletal muscles are attached to bones by tough connective tissues.

93
00:10:37,157 --> 00:10:38,778
We call those tissues tendons.

94
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:44,524
One end of the muscle is attached to the bone that does not move.

95
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:47,006
we call that the origin.

96
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:54,439
The opposite end is fixed to a different bone and we call that the insertion.

97
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:58,466
And that one is moved during muscular contraction.

98
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:07,542
And so here we can look at the masseter muscle here and it's moving the mandible up and down here.

99
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:16,642
So this is kind of basic origin and insertion that

100
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:21,628
just helps us determine whether you're actually moving another bone.

101
00:11:21,628 --> 00:11:26,875
We also want to get into the structure of the skeletal muscle.

102
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:33,262
So it's good to, or I recommend maybe starting here and then kind of working your way down.

103
00:11:33,262 --> 00:11:36,566
You definitely can start lower and work your way up.

104
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:38,268
But if we are looking at

105
00:11:38,268 --> 00:11:41,030
This little chart here, we go from muscle to fascicles

106
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:46,295
to cells or fibers, and then myofibrils, and then thick and thin filaments.

107
00:11:46,295 --> 00:11:48,998
So here on the top, we have an entire muscle.

108
00:11:49,838 --> 00:11:55,583
And then inside of this muscle bundle, we have our fascicle.

109
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,546
And then inside of the fascicle, we have a muscle fiber.

110
00:11:58,546 --> 00:12:01,669
And then inside the fibers, we have myofibrils.

111
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:07,414
And then inside of there, we have our kind of contractile protein, the sarcomeres.

112
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:12,325
So these are kind of where we're actually generating the force.

113
00:12:18,477 --> 00:12:21,343
We'll touch on this a little bit more, but the big

114
00:12:21,343 --> 00:12:24,850
thing or I guess controversy that we kind of have or

115
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:30,918
debate in exercise physiology is can we increase the number of fibers?

116
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:34,465
And we'll touch on that, but in general, we typically

117
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:38,393
don't increase the number of fibers, we typically increase the

118
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:42,080
number of sarcomeres, and we do that in parallel.

119
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,425
But again, we'll touch on that when we get to that topic.

120
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:52,619
So, no, you don't have to memorize these, but if we start talking about

121
00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:58,989
increase in muscle fibers or changes in muscle fibers, you know we're talking at this level.

122
00:12:58,989 --> 00:13:01,913
If we're talking about sarcomeres, we're talking at this level here.

123
00:13:05,979 --> 00:13:10,065
Okay, but we don't just have a bunch of muscle fibers or sarcomeres.

124
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:15,133
We have other structures that are very important in muscular contractions.

125
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,843
For example, we have mitochondria, we have the

126
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:24,833
transverse T-tubules, we have sarcoplasma, sarcolemma, we have all

127
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:28,058
kinds of things that are associated with the muscle fiber.

128
00:13:31,964 --> 00:13:34,688
Some of the more important organelles that we will be

129
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:42,420
focusing on will be the mitochondria as well as some of the nuclei that are surrounding the muscle fiber.

130
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:47,883
So skeletal muscle fibers are very unique because they have

131
00:13:47,883 --> 00:13:55,094
a lot of nuclei among or around the entire length of the muscle fiber.

132
00:14:00,582 --> 00:14:04,428
And as far as the mitochondria, this also makes sense

133
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:10,618
to me because if these contractile proteins are in high demand of energy,

134
00:14:11,662 --> 00:14:16,087
Well, we would need the organelles that are responsible for generating a lot of energy.

135
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:22,795
So we have a lot of mitochondria on the surface and within the muscle cells.

136
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:33,408
Two distinct mitochondria or subpopulations of mitochondria that we'll be focusing on.

137
00:14:33,408 --> 00:14:37,753
One would be the subsarcolemia mitochondria or the SS mitochondria.

138
00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:44,617
This is located directly underneath the cell membrane or the sarcolemma.

139
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:54,110
These mitochondria are more important or they kind of

140
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,355
supply the majority of the energy, the cellular energy to

141
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:01,800
maintain active transport of ions across the sarcolemma.

142
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:07,945
Does anyone remember, you don't need to know this, but sometimes it's nice to think about it,

143
00:15:07,945 --> 00:15:11,850
but does anyone remember what those transporters are or

144
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,896
what they're called or what they're transporting or moving across the sarcolemma?

145
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,001
Any ideas?

146
00:15:23,804 --> 00:15:24,085
Say again?

147
00:15:25,587 --> 00:15:32,395
So yeah, not in this instance, but maybe just to establish the membrane potential.

148
00:15:33,877 --> 00:15:36,080
Yeah, the sodium potassium pumps.

149
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,143
So that's essentially what they are powering here.

150
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:45,834
OK, the intermyofibular mitochondria or the IMF, these are

151
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:52,283
located near the myofibular proteins or those contractile proteins.

152
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:58,872
These are the mitochondria that are supplying the ATP needed for contraction.

153
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:06,757
This is just a longitudinal section of a skeletal

154
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:12,675
muscle that are showing the different mitochondria that are kind of dispersed along these cells.

155
00:16:16,587 --> 00:16:23,497
OK, so how do we go from a single cell to these muscle fibers?

156
00:16:23,497 --> 00:16:25,580
Well, we have these myoblasts.

157
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,445
They differentiate into satellite cells.

158
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:31,228
They get some nuclei.

159
00:16:31,228 --> 00:16:33,691
And then you have an immature muscle fiber that then

160
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:36,435
eventually develops into this muscle fiber in itself.

161
00:16:39,335 --> 00:16:45,382
So the key piece here which we'll talk about would be the myoblasts and then the satellite cells.

162
00:16:45,382 --> 00:16:50,569
It's kind of the focus that this slide is trying to get you to look at here.

163
00:16:53,132 --> 00:16:55,154
What are satellite cells?

164
00:16:55,154 --> 00:17:01,782
Well, satellite cells are important cells that play a role in muscle growth and repair.

165
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:09,431
If an individual is in the process of creating more

166
00:17:09,431 --> 00:17:18,501
muscle fibers or even, I guess, sarcomeres, we increase the number of satellite cells.

167
00:17:20,503 --> 00:17:23,426
In addition, we increase the number of nuclei.

168
00:17:28,892 --> 00:17:33,777
So, more nuclei allow for greater protein synthesis.

169
00:17:35,393 --> 00:17:40,239
we are reliant on these nuclei for muscle growth.

170
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:46,366
Because of that, if we increase a lot of these nuclei,

171
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:56,659
we typically see a large change in those numbers as we experience hypertrophy or muscle growth.

172
00:17:58,175 --> 00:18:03,004
The nice thing about that, these nuclei are slow

173
00:18:03,004 --> 00:18:06,811
to degrade compared to the actual muscles themselves.

174
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:14,686
So the sarcomeres kind of reduce at a faster rate compared to the nuclei.

175
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:19,575
And so when you get some type of atrophy or loss of muscle,

176
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,205
you maintain the nuclei that are surrounding the fibers.

177
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:31,171
And so it takes a shorter time to get you back to the previous state of hypertrophy.

178
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:39,700
So here we have that untrained individual.

179
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,884
You get the satellite cell fusion that are going to increase the number of nuclei.

180
00:18:43,884 --> 00:18:47,973
And that's going to really help with hypertrophy.

181
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:57,007
If you are under a state of detraining or atrophy, you will maintain the number of nuclei.

182
00:18:57,007 --> 00:19:01,554
That way retraining becomes a lot easier or you decrease the

183
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:04,177
time to get to the same level of hypertrophy.

184
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:13,812
Okay, functions of skeletal muscle.

185
00:19:15,277 --> 00:19:19,604
Ultimately, we think of skeletal muscle as force production cells

186
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:23,991
that really help us do work as far as mechanical work.

187
00:19:25,313 --> 00:19:30,602
We also produce force in order for us to move air in and out of our lungs.

188
00:19:32,455 --> 00:19:36,787
Everyone right now is experiencing some sort of postural support.

189
00:19:36,787 --> 00:19:39,334
So me standing up right now, are you sitting, right?

190
00:19:39,334 --> 00:19:42,122
We're able to maintain posture, and that's because our

191
00:19:42,122 --> 00:19:46,414
muscles are using some sort of force production.

192
00:19:47,272 --> 00:19:50,175
The one piece that I know we all know about but

193
00:19:50,175 --> 00:19:56,943
we kind of forget sometimes would be that our muscles are extremely good at generating heat.

194
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,347
We kind of touched on this concept before because our

195
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:04,913
muscles or our body's ability to convert food energy into

196
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:11,060
actual kind of mechanical work, it's not very good at that, right?

197
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,121
We're not very efficient.

198
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:15,925
We actually generate

199
00:20:15,925 --> 00:20:21,811
a substantial amount of heat when we are converting some of the energy in our bodies.

200
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:24,334
So this is the piece right here.

201
00:20:27,297 --> 00:20:30,500
A more recent function of the skeletal muscle that I

202
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,825
kind of introduced in the previous unit would be muscle as an endocrine gland.

203
00:20:37,307 --> 00:20:42,372
So skeletal muscles produce something called myokines during contraction.

204
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:49,893
Some of the signals that are believed to be sent are

205
00:20:49,893 --> 00:20:54,558
dealing with glucose update as well as fatty acid oxidation.

206
00:20:57,501 --> 00:21:02,446
These signals also promote blood vessel growth or capillary

207
00:21:02,446 --> 00:21:07,772
density inside of the muscle or around the muscle.

208
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:11,616
And then they also promote liver glucose production and triglyceride breakdown.

209
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:17,170
There are other functions that we've kind of touched on.

210
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,376
One of those myokine signals were believed to help

211
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:25,523
with the glute four translocation to the surface of the membrane to bring glucose in.

212
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,813
Some other ones would be interleukin-6, IL-6.

213
00:21:33,695 --> 00:21:38,582
This is just a pro and anti-inflammatory signal.

214
00:21:42,173 --> 00:21:48,963
If we undergo kind of regular submaximal kind of moderate exercise intensity,

215
00:21:48,963 --> 00:21:55,052
that can help promote an anti-inflammatory environment and

216
00:21:55,052 --> 00:21:59,539
reduce some of that chronic inflammation and reduced risk of

217
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:03,565
heart disease and other types of metabolic disorders.

218
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:11,080
So we've kind of touched on this one already about

219
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,284
You know, this concept of inflammation and how acute

220
00:22:15,284 --> 00:22:18,787
inflammation cannot necessarily always be a bad thing.

221
00:22:18,787 --> 00:22:21,770
We always kind of label it as a bad thing, but it can be quite helpful.

222
00:22:22,931 --> 00:22:25,814
Chronic inflammation is something that we try to reduce,

223
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:29,778
and regular exercise activity can help that.

224
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,885
Okay, muscle actions will be the next topic here.

225
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:40,789
This one's pretty straightforward, right?

226
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:46,761
We can either have some type of action where we're, if I'm looking at the joint angle,

227
00:22:46,761 --> 00:22:51,329
my elbow here, I can flex and decrease the joint angle

228
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:58,624
here or I can extend and that's gonna increase the joint angle.

229
00:22:58,624 --> 00:23:02,431
So these are two types of movements that we have.

230
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:06,278
But we also know we can produce quite a bit of

231
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:13,129
force without actually changing the length of the object or even the joint angle.

232
00:23:14,732 --> 00:23:20,743
So static actions, static muscle actions are just when you

233
00:23:20,743 --> 00:23:27,915
are trying to produce force, but you're not really changing any distance or muscle or joint angles.

234
00:23:30,747 --> 00:23:34,077
So if I were to just press on this wall here, and

235
00:23:34,077 --> 00:23:37,227
I'm trying to move the wall, well, the wall wouldn't move, but

236
00:23:37,227 --> 00:23:40,116
I'm generating a lot of force and attempt to move the wall.

237
00:23:45,361 --> 00:23:48,965
Okay, so now we have these three kind of

238
00:23:48,965 --> 00:23:55,913
major muscle actions or force-generating pieces, right, flexion, extension, and static.

239
00:23:56,814 --> 00:24:03,902
We wanna talk about going back to the flexion and extension, some type of dynamic movement.

240
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:07,225
So dynamic movement, we're just talking about movement, right?

241
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:08,787
If I have a static movement,

242
00:24:09,678 --> 00:24:13,922
That's you can't really have static movement But if you have a static muscle

243
00:24:13,922 --> 00:24:21,190
that muscles not moving if we have a dynamic muscle it is moving concentric Activities

244
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:26,094
or actions are when the muscle shortens during force production

245
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,584
So in this instance you would have an arm kind of holding a weight down here and

246
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:40,124
And moving it up, if we're talking about the bicep, the

247
00:24:40,124 --> 00:24:44,110
bicep is flexing, and this is a concentric motion.

248
00:24:46,654 --> 00:24:48,738
So muscle shortening during the force production.

249
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:56,770
Eccentric is where we have the force production, but the

250
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:02,219
joint angle, if we're talking about the bicep here, is getting larger.

251
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:04,002
So the length is increasing here.

252
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:12,656
These eccentric movements are extremely important when an individual

253
00:25:12,656 --> 00:25:15,979
is trying to focus on muscle growth.

254
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,783
The reason being is it causes the majority of the

255
00:25:19,783 --> 00:25:27,209
muscle fiber injury, then your body responds to that stress by hypertrophy or growing and repairing those.

256
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,552
But it is also associated with the majority of the

257
00:25:30,552 --> 00:25:35,136
soreness that we experience during any type of weight-bearing exercise.

258
00:25:37,377 --> 00:25:39,580
So this will be important when we start talking

259
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,524
about these concepts of muscle injury and soreness.

260
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:46,330
It's the eccentric motions that are causing the most damage.

261
00:25:50,596 --> 00:25:53,239
Okay, this is a little summary slide of everything that

262
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:55,863
we just kinda went over on the muscle actions.

263
00:25:55,863 --> 00:26:00,870
So if you would like to kind of review things, this might be a good table to look at.

264
00:26:01,897 --> 00:26:04,920
So if in a couple weeks you can look at the slide

265
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:13,588
and you can define all these terms here, you're gonna be in good shape.

266
00:26:13,588 --> 00:26:18,152
Okay, muscles just can't contract on their own.

267
00:26:18,152 --> 00:26:22,896
They need to be sent a signal to tell the muscles to contract.

268
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:29,642
This is where we get into this neural muscular junction and contraction topic here.

269
00:26:30,972 --> 00:26:33,639
But before we do that, it's nice to talk about

270
00:26:33,639 --> 00:26:36,548
the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system here.

271
00:26:37,591 --> 00:26:41,782
So the central nervous system is the brain and the spinal cord, right?

272
00:26:41,782 --> 00:26:46,315
So we're just talking about the central or the center of the body.

273
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:50,092
This is also a good point to talk about, like if

274
00:26:50,092 --> 00:26:53,577
you've ever heard, you may have seen this question already,

275
00:26:53,577 --> 00:26:58,623
but if we talk about central versus peripheral fatigue, this is kind of what it's referring to.

276
00:26:58,623 --> 00:27:04,311
Maybe central nervous system is responsible for some of that fatigue versus the periphery.

277
00:27:06,434 --> 00:27:08,917
Okay, peripheral nervous system is over here.

278
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:12,281
We're gonna be looking at the motor division.

279
00:27:12,281 --> 00:27:17,834
There are two branches, somatic as well as the autonomic.

280
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:23,081
we're gonna be focusing on the somatic nervous system for these skeletal muscles.

281
00:27:27,427 --> 00:27:30,932
Okay, somatic motor neurons of the peripheral nervous

282
00:27:30,932 --> 00:27:36,779
system are responsible for sending that signal from the spinal cord to the skeletal muscles.

283
00:27:37,821 --> 00:27:41,586
So when I'm telling my arm to move, that signal's coming

284
00:27:41,586 --> 00:27:46,913
from the brain moving all the way down and getting the arm to move through the somatic motor neurons.

285
00:27:49,913 --> 00:27:57,546
Each one of these neurons, motor neurons, are synapsing on a number of different fibers.

286
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:04,898
We can compile or kind of categorize the motor neuron

287
00:28:04,898 --> 00:28:09,545
and all the fibers that it happens to innervate as a motor unit.

288
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:16,056
So if we have this motor neuron here and it's synapsing on these different fibers,

289
00:28:17,048 --> 00:28:23,236
Well, the neuron as well as the fibers in that junction is the motor unit.

290
00:28:29,384 --> 00:28:37,074
Here's just another kind of figure showing that motor unit.

291
00:28:37,074 --> 00:28:41,740
So we have the neuron here, and it's synapsing on these different fibers here.

292
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:53,024
This synapse here kind of forms a motor end plate.

293
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:59,895
So this pocket formed around the motor neuron by the sarcolemma here.

294
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:08,368
We can then zoom in on this area here to kind of just see the motor end plate.

295
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:17,245
So if you remember, we're going to just review some of this physiology.

296
00:29:17,245 --> 00:29:18,626
You get that signal from the brain.

297
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:19,948
It goes all the way down.

298
00:29:19,948 --> 00:29:22,691
We get to that motor end plate or that junction.

299
00:29:24,213 --> 00:29:27,417
Calcium is rushing in kind of into the motor neuron.

300
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:29,760
And then from there, acetylcholine is released.

301
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,542
It then binds to the sarcolemma.

302
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:34,586
And then you get that signal to go down the T-tubule.

303
00:29:34,586 --> 00:29:36,128
We're going to talk about all that.

304
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,550
And then you get into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

305
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,494
Calcium comes out in that whole fun process.

306
00:29:43,347 --> 00:29:48,893
But before we do that, we need to talk about what is that kind of functional unit.

307
00:29:51,637 --> 00:29:54,340
This is the functional unit.

308
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:58,384
So sarcomeres are that functional unit that we're gonna be talking about.

309
00:29:58,384 --> 00:30:02,629
They contain specialized arrangements of thin and thick filaments.

310
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,573
When we're talking about the thin filaments, we're

311
00:30:05,573 --> 00:30:08,356
talking about the actin, tropomyosin, and troponin.

312
00:30:09,677 --> 00:30:11,920
The thick filaments are the myosin.

313
00:30:15,258 --> 00:30:19,063
To make sure we can kind of understand the movement of

314
00:30:19,063 --> 00:30:27,454
the sarcomere, we need to make sure we remember or review some of the major components of a sarcomere.

315
00:30:27,454 --> 00:30:33,242
So we have our Z line, our M line, kind of the I band, A band, and the H zone.

316
00:30:35,244 --> 00:30:37,728
All of those can be found up here, right?

317
00:30:37,728 --> 00:30:42,514
So we have our M line, which is basically this centerpiece right here.

318
00:30:44,738 --> 00:30:49,484
And then if we want the Z disk, we're looking at this

319
00:30:49,484 --> 00:30:57,193
kind of Z structure or Z pattern right here, which is also in this piece right here.

320
00:30:59,035 --> 00:31:08,718
If we want to look at the I band, it would be kind of the spacing between the myosin.

321
00:31:08,718 --> 00:31:15,045
So if we're looking at this spacing that's over the Z disc, that would be this I band.

322
00:31:18,028 --> 00:31:23,554
And then the A band would be just the length of these thick filaments right here.

323
00:31:23,554 --> 00:31:25,396
So if we're looking at the A band, we're over here.

324
00:31:26,658 --> 00:31:34,907
And then the H zone would just be in this kind of in between the thin filaments.

325
00:31:34,907 --> 00:31:38,691
So between this one and this one would be the H zone here.

326
00:31:39,768 --> 00:31:43,571
And we're gonna basically be closing in on the H zone during contraction.

327
00:31:45,193 --> 00:31:47,495
Or you would reduce the H zone.

328
00:31:50,258 --> 00:31:53,180
So no worries if you don't remember this from anatomy,

329
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:58,265
physiology, but you'll just spend a little bit of time reviewing these pieces here.

330
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:07,713
Okay, so how do we actually get a muscular contraction?

331
00:32:07,713 --> 00:32:11,659
Well, this is happening due to something called the sliding filament model.

332
00:32:14,122 --> 00:32:16,826
So we can get that H zone to kind of

333
00:32:16,826 --> 00:32:23,196
compress by shortening these sarcomeres, or these muscles, due to

334
00:32:23,196 --> 00:32:26,621
the movement of the thin filament over the thick filament.

335
00:32:28,523 --> 00:32:31,768
In order for those two to make a connection and

336
00:32:31,768 --> 00:32:35,914
have that movement, we need to form something called a cross bridge.

337
00:32:39,742 --> 00:32:44,450
Once you make that cross bridge, those myosin heads can

338
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:51,242
then pull on those thin filaments and again cause the sarcomere to kind of shorten or contract.

339
00:32:54,067 --> 00:33:02,442
When that sarcomere does contract, we can see the spacing here changes.

340
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:12,457
So we're reducing the distance between the z lines of each sarcomere that's lined up.

341
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,059
So if we have one sarcomere on the other one.

342
00:33:22,288 --> 00:33:26,993
If you are bringing the z lines closer to each other, you're also closing this gap here.

343
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:34,622
As you can see with these kind of subsequent figures.

344
00:33:43,225 --> 00:33:48,994
Okay, let's take a few minutes, just in case, if you

345
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:54,163
haven't already, and label the diagram of the sarcomere with the appropriate terms.

346
00:33:55,765 --> 00:33:57,829
So we'll take a couple minutes.

347
00:33:57,829 --> 00:34:01,234
This will be a nice little break for you to review some of these pieces.

348
00:36:08,806 --> 00:36:10,148
Okay, how are we doing with this one?

349
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:12,892
Doing okay?

350
00:36:12,892 --> 00:36:13,913
Anyone need a little more time?

351
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:23,887
Okay, so I would say it would be good, we won't spend too much time on this

352
00:36:23,887 --> 00:36:27,672
because I've already went through it, but it would be good

353
00:36:27,672 --> 00:36:33,179
to make sure and fill in this chart or circle the correct answer.

354
00:36:36,203 --> 00:36:37,932
That way,

355
00:36:37,932 --> 00:36:41,040
you can prepare yourself for questions like this one.

356
00:36:45,974 --> 00:36:50,245
During a bicep curl, the sarcomeres within the biceps brachii shorten.

357
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:53,494
What else will shorten within the sarcomere?

358
00:38:23,975 --> 00:38:33,229
All right, let's take maybe 30 more seconds on this one, unless you need more time.

359
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:34,631
I'll check back in in 30 seconds.

360
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:47,210
Not that I need to remind you, but is there anything going on with the clicker questions?

361
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:53,239
Is there any unique advantage to getting the clicker questions right?

362
00:38:55,193 --> 00:38:55,595
Say again?

363
00:38:56,841 --> 00:38:57,544
Yeah, yeah.

364
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:01,926
So if we can get 100%, I'm gonna put it on the exam.

365
00:39:01,926 --> 00:39:04,056
So just throwing that out there.

366
00:39:32,926 --> 00:39:48,336
Thank you.

367
00:40:03,689 --> 00:40:07,753
Okay, I'll close this one up here in 10 seconds.

368
00:40:11,157 --> 00:40:13,219
Double check that you have something in.

369
00:40:16,222 --> 00:40:19,205
All right, three, two, one.

370
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,612
Okay, nice job, nice job.

371
00:40:28,415 --> 00:40:32,599
The correct answer is E.

372
00:40:35,093 --> 00:40:44,225
And B. So if you remember, the H zone and the I band do shorten or you kind of close those areas.

373
00:40:44,225 --> 00:40:47,449
The A band is just the length of the thick filaments.

374
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:49,211
So that'll never really change.

375
00:40:52,656 --> 00:40:56,741
So here's that H zone here and then the I band over here.

376
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:03,109
The A band is just, again, the length of the thick filaments.

377
00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:12,976
Okay, you probably knew this was coming, but we're

378
00:41:12,976 --> 00:41:19,769
gonna talk about the relationships among troponin, tropomycin, mycin, and calcium.

379
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:19,909
Right?

380
00:41:22,254 --> 00:41:22,735
So.

381
00:41:24,453 --> 00:41:28,037
We already talked about this, but if you just remember,

382
00:41:28,037 --> 00:41:32,183
calcium is gonna be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and

383
00:41:32,183 --> 00:41:35,306
then you're gonna get that calcium to bind to troponin.

384
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:38,410
That's gonna cause a conformational change in these

385
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:41,995
little strands right here called the tropomycin.

386
00:41:41,995 --> 00:41:45,639
That's gonna reveal the actin binding site, and that's gonna

387
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:51,166
allow for these myosin heads here to then bind and form a cross bridge.

388
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:57,258
and then you'll have that movement or these heads pivot in order for us to get that power stroke.

389
00:42:01,607 --> 00:42:09,343
To have all of this continue to cycle, we need energy during this process.

390
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:17,061
So ATP is required for muscular contraction, but I mean,

391
00:42:17,061 --> 00:42:20,788
we know overall it's part of the contraction, but the actual

392
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:29,543
role for ATP, does anyone remember what the ATP directly does when it kind of gets to the myosin head?

393
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:37,919
Yeah, so that actually causes the release of the myosin

394
00:42:37,919 --> 00:42:40,161
head and then you have the interactions to kind of get it

395
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:43,464
into the kind of high energy state a little bit later.

396
00:42:43,464 --> 00:42:45,466
That way you don't waste any time.

397
00:42:45,466 --> 00:42:48,909
So as soon as that actin site is available or that

398
00:42:48,909 --> 00:42:52,112
binding site is available, then the myosin head will grab onto it.

399
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:56,336
So you don't have to waste time into getting into that kind of high energy state.

400
00:42:57,156 --> 00:43:03,982
But myosin ATPase breaks down the ATP as the fiber contracts.

401
00:43:03,982 --> 00:43:06,606
This is kind of that interaction that we've already

402
00:43:06,606 --> 00:43:10,032
kind of touched on before, where you're breaking the ATP down

403
00:43:10,032 --> 00:43:15,801
into ADP, but it releases a phosphate as well as some energy.

404
00:43:19,587 --> 00:43:22,772
We don't need to spend time right now going

405
00:43:22,772 --> 00:43:28,120
through the ATP sources for muscular contraction because we've already done that.

406
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,305
But this might be a quick review slide that might be helpful.

407
00:43:34,795 --> 00:43:38,240
Even though I already did it for you, let's

408
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:45,249
place the five stages of the excitation-contraction coupling in the correct order.

409
00:43:46,651 --> 00:43:50,216
Use one for the earliest event and five for the latest event.

410
00:43:51,217 --> 00:43:56,885
If you need some reference on the order, the one is up

411
00:43:56,885 --> 00:44:02,693
here and the five is down here, and start labeling the appropriate ones

412
00:44:03,618 --> 00:44:05,443
for the descriptions down here.

413
00:45:34,692 --> 00:45:36,194
Okay, are we doing pretty good with this one?

414
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:39,960
You're like, ah, it's too easy.

415
00:45:40,922 --> 00:45:42,845
Well, let's see how easy it was.

416
00:45:50,116 --> 00:45:51,899
Reading from top to bottom.

417
00:45:51,899 --> 00:45:57,207
What are the five steps of the excitation contraction coupling?

418
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:44,037
OK, let's go another 20 seconds, 30.

419
00:46:46,164 --> 00:46:47,528
We'll go 30 seconds from here.

420
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:13,518
Okay, does anyone need a little more time?

421
00:47:16,302 --> 00:47:20,748
Okay, I'll close it down in three, two, one.

422
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:27,779
All right, nice job.

423
00:47:27,779 --> 00:47:30,563
Most of us got this correct.

424
00:47:32,005 --> 00:47:40,397
We are looking for D. No, oh, you wanna see, yeah.

425
00:47:44,748 --> 00:47:45,989
87.

426
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:47,191
That's not bad, though.

427
00:47:47,191 --> 00:47:47,952
That's good.

428
00:47:47,952 --> 00:47:48,372
That's good.

429
00:47:49,293 --> 00:47:49,494
OK.

430
00:47:50,315 --> 00:47:52,037
So the first one we're going to be dealing

431
00:47:52,037 --> 00:47:57,743
with, action potential stimulates acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction.

432
00:47:57,743 --> 00:48:02,008
Acetylcholine produces that action potential that then propagates

433
00:48:02,008 --> 00:48:05,072
across the sarcolemma down the T-tubule.

434
00:48:05,072 --> 00:48:10,338
Action potential gets calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

435
00:48:10,338 --> 00:48:12,541
Calcium binds the troponin.

436
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:16,807
initiate tropomycin displacement, revealing those binding sites, and

437
00:48:16,807 --> 00:48:19,290
then you get the mycin forming the cross bridge.

438
00:48:20,352 --> 00:48:25,820
Okay, so then when you get the cross bridge, what happens?

439
00:48:27,522 --> 00:48:33,290
So let's place the following seven stages of the cross bridge cycling in the correct order.

440
00:48:34,392 --> 00:48:37,536
You probably know what's coming after this, so.

441
00:50:05,215 --> 00:50:10,562
I guess technically you only had to do six stages, because you have the first one at least.

442
00:50:14,647 --> 00:50:29,586
Okay, when you're ready, let's put them in order, rating from top to bottom here.

443
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:05,441
Okay, let's take a couple more seconds with this, unless someone needs a little more time.

444
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:12,912
We have, I think, one clicker missing.

445
00:54:15,856 --> 00:54:17,438
I'll close it down in 10 seconds here.

446
00:54:22,546 --> 00:54:27,473
Five, three, two, one.

447
00:54:29,663 --> 00:54:32,586
Okay, how did we do?

448
00:54:32,586 --> 00:54:37,170
We did great, nice job.

449
00:54:40,773 --> 00:54:48,079
Okay, yes, the correct answer would be B. So we can,

450
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,904
you can kind of look through these and view them on your own time here.

451
00:54:52,904 --> 00:54:57,848
So hopefully this was a little bit of review from physiology as well as anatomy.

452
00:54:59,077 --> 00:55:08,507
But overall, these steps are pretty important for you to understand so we know

453
00:55:08,507 --> 00:55:12,691
if there was an issue at one of these steps because

454
00:55:12,691 --> 00:55:17,877
of exercise or because of something going on, it's nice

455
00:55:17,877 --> 00:55:21,361
to know where in that process something's being disturbed.

456
00:55:23,663 --> 00:55:24,544
For example,

457
00:55:28,203 --> 00:55:30,727
I know I'm hitting you with a lot of clicker questions

458
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:35,834
today, but I'm trying to give some relevant type questions.

459
00:55:35,834 --> 00:55:40,741
If an athlete takes a drug that increases calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum,

460
00:55:40,741 --> 00:55:44,226
but it does not enhance muscle contraction, it is

461
00:55:44,226 --> 00:55:47,150
suspected that the drug accidentally bound to the thin filament,

462
00:55:48,172 --> 00:55:50,635
blockade of which structure in the thin filament would

463
00:55:50,635 --> 00:55:53,299
prevent calcium binding and skeletal muscle contraction.

464
00:56:59,918 --> 00:57:03,047
OK, how are we doing with this one?

465
00:57:04,652 --> 00:57:05,273
A little more time?

466
00:57:07,921 --> 00:57:09,164
See one or two nods.

467
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:13,236
Let's go another 20 seconds then.

468
00:57:32,234 --> 00:57:37,442
All right, I'll close this down in three, two, one.

469
00:57:38,563 --> 00:57:41,548
Oh, we're getting more clickers.

470
00:57:41,548 --> 00:57:43,130
Now I'll close it down.

471
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:45,774
Three, two, one.

472
00:57:48,658 --> 00:57:49,579
Okay, how'd we do?

473
00:57:52,564 --> 00:57:54,086
Oh, I thought we were, that's okay.

474
00:57:54,086 --> 00:57:54,687
No, this is good.

475
00:57:55,608 --> 00:57:56,910
This is good.

476
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:57,191
Okay.

477
00:57:59,634 --> 00:58:01,617
So the correct answer is D.

478
00:58:03,908 --> 00:58:06,512
Does the structure of this clicker question look familiar?

479
00:58:06,512 --> 00:58:09,317
Does that seem like close to the exams?

480
00:58:09,317 --> 00:58:10,298
Okay.

481
00:58:10,298 --> 00:58:15,987
So, hopefully I can keep giving exam-style questions on

482
00:58:15,987 --> 00:58:19,754
these clicker questions to get you thinking.

483
00:58:19,754 --> 00:58:24,498
If someone was trying to enhance contractions by increasing

484
00:58:24,498 --> 00:58:27,821
the amount of calcium that's being released, you first have

485
00:58:27,821 --> 00:58:33,667
to recognize what calcium is doing in that entire process.

486
00:58:33,667 --> 00:58:37,570
Calcium, getting released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, is

487
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:42,755
binding to troponin, and that way you can initiate that

488
00:58:42,755 --> 00:58:45,898
whole cross-bridge cycle to get that muscle contraction.

489
00:58:46,838 --> 00:58:50,298
If I take a drug, or I take anything,

490
00:58:50,298 --> 00:58:55,386
and inadvertently that drug also binds to something that

491
00:58:55,386 --> 00:59:01,356
blocks any type of myosin head from binding to an area

492
00:59:01,356 --> 00:59:06,485
or from tropomyosin from even moving, that would be a big problem.

493
00:59:06,485 --> 00:59:13,757
In this one, the problem is that calcium cannot bind to something to move tropomyosin.

494
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,806
In that instance, the only thing that could be would

495
00:59:18,806 --> 00:59:21,632
be the binding site for calcium, which is troponin.

496
00:59:23,496 --> 00:59:24,719
Are we OK with this question?

497
00:59:25,781 --> 00:59:28,707
Does anyone have any comments or concerns?

498
00:59:29,749 --> 00:59:30,952
Or maybe even in the wording?

499
00:59:35,481 --> 00:59:35,762
OK.

500
00:59:42,172 --> 00:59:45,797
Okay, let's move on to exercise-associated muscle cramps.

501
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:50,384
This is just a clicker-filled day today.

502
00:59:51,645 --> 00:59:52,447
True or false?

503
00:59:53,328 --> 00:59:56,412
Salt tablets, bananas, pickle juice, and sports drinks

504
00:59:56,412 --> 01:00:00,518
can prevent and relieve exercise-induced muscle cramps.

505
01:00:32,324 --> 01:00:34,566
Okay, let's go 20 more seconds here.

506
01:00:42,315 --> 01:00:43,095
Five clickers.

507
01:00:45,858 --> 01:00:48,761
Three, two, one more.

508
01:00:51,765 --> 01:00:57,190
Okay, I'll close this down in three, two, one.

509
01:01:00,594 --> 01:01:01,079
Okay.

510
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:05,567
I like to show this only because it's nice to see where everyone's at, right?

511
01:01:06,548 --> 01:01:08,151
Most people are saying true here.

512
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:13,039
I'm not gonna grade it because we're gonna talk about this here.

513
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:17,367
I hope I get a lot of feedback here from the group.

514
01:01:19,991 --> 01:01:21,113
Okay, muscle cramps.

515
01:01:22,493 --> 01:01:27,759
Muscle cramps could be kind of defined as a

516
01:01:27,759 --> 01:01:32,184
kind of involuntary muscle contraction that's happening at maybe a

517
01:01:32,184 --> 01:01:37,209
higher rate and you kind of feel your muscles tense up, right?

518
01:01:37,209 --> 01:01:40,012
So you get that muscle cramp.

519
01:01:40,012 --> 01:01:45,278
Often, people associate this with prolonged high-intensity exercise.

520
01:01:46,372 --> 01:01:50,376
There is a theory that most of you believe,

521
01:01:50,376 --> 01:01:54,381
which is the electrolyte depletion and dehydration theory.

522
01:01:54,381 --> 01:02:02,270
This theory states that water and sodium loss via sweating causes spontaneous muscle contractions.

523
01:02:04,773 --> 01:02:08,537
These contractions are more likely to occur in a hot environment.

524
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,805
This is where we're gonna ruffle some feathers here.

525
01:02:16,662 --> 01:02:21,331
To date though, few, if not any studies support

526
01:02:21,331 --> 01:02:26,721
the concept that exercise induced muscle cramps result from the electrolyte imbalance.

527
01:02:28,965 --> 01:02:33,514
This has been well established in the exercise physiology community.

528
01:02:35,557 --> 01:02:38,603
But I like to throw it out to the group.

529
01:02:40,287 --> 01:02:43,192
What are some of the limitations of the electrolyte

530
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:46,217
depletion and dehydration theory to explain muscle cramps?

531
01:02:47,259 --> 01:02:50,304
So based on what you've heard, what you've learned maybe in

532
01:02:50,304 --> 01:02:56,354
the past, to get you to answer true, 98% of us answer

533
01:02:56,354 --> 01:03:04,388
true, but I just told you that very few studies support this concept or this theory.

534
01:03:06,022 --> 01:03:11,094
So try to go onto the other side and poke holes into your existing belief.

535
01:03:11,094 --> 01:03:13,340
What are some limitations of the electrolyte depletion

536
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:17,570
and dehydration theory in explaining muscle cramps?

537
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:19,595
So try to chat with your classmates for a little bit

538
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:22,883
and let's come up with a few maybe limitations of this theory.

539
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:24,390
Okay, what are we thinking?

540
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:30,244
Can I get some ideas from this side of the room here?

541
01:04:30,244 --> 01:04:31,788
Not that I'm picking on this side at all.

542
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:36,098
But put on your like, your researcher hat, right?

543
01:04:38,183 --> 01:04:40,117
You want to...

544
01:04:40,117 --> 01:04:43,906
come up or provide some evidence to support your

545
01:04:43,906 --> 01:04:47,815
previous claim, right, true versus false, that there needs to

546
01:04:47,815 --> 01:04:52,988
be some type of electrolyte solution that is going to help reduce cramps.

547
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:58,797
If that is the case, right, because we need to be careful with associations.

548
01:04:58,797 --> 01:05:03,106
Just because something's associated doesn't mean there's a causal relationship.

549
01:05:03,106 --> 01:05:05,211
So how do we parse this out?

550
01:05:05,211 --> 01:05:09,159
So one, either come up with some limitations, or two,

551
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:12,687
maybe come up with a study design really quick.

552
01:05:12,687 --> 01:05:14,190
So what are we thinking on this side?

553
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:18,780
How could we prove this, or how could we look at this, or what are some limitations here?

554
01:05:24,818 --> 01:05:29,744
Yeah, yeah, so that's one of the easiest and the first studies that were done.

555
01:05:29,744 --> 01:05:33,529
Just get two individuals or two groups of individuals, have

556
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:41,099
them go out, one has electrolytes and one does not, and see whether one group cramps more than the other.

557
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,382
So that's a good one.

558
01:05:43,382 --> 01:05:43,703
What else?

559
01:05:51,513 --> 01:05:52,294
Any ideas?

560
01:05:53,253 --> 01:05:56,017
What are some limitations or ways we can look at this?

561
01:06:05,672 --> 01:06:09,798
Say that one more time.

562
01:06:09,798 --> 01:06:13,624
Yeah, so we just spent a lot of time on these clicker questions.

563
01:06:14,853 --> 01:06:18,499
Tell me where on there that we're having a really

564
01:06:18,499 --> 01:06:25,650
big issue with blood concentrations of these electrolytes and in the muscle contractions.

565
01:06:30,257 --> 01:06:31,999
Yeah, yeah.

566
01:06:31,999 --> 01:06:36,206
I will say a lot of that still kind of local

567
01:06:36,206 --> 01:06:43,439
inside of the muscle in the sarcoplasmic reticulum does a perfectly fine job of providing enough calcium.

568
01:06:43,439 --> 01:06:49,670
Now, there could be issues with the re-uptake of calcium, or if I have acetylcholine

569
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:52,555
and acetylcholine esterase isn't there to clear that up, so

570
01:06:52,555 --> 01:06:58,766
you're sending that signal on and on and on, but that has nothing to do with eating a banana.

571
01:07:01,571 --> 01:07:02,713
Any other limitations?

572
01:07:06,018 --> 01:07:09,423
So one of the things we can think about is the same concept for lactate.

573
01:07:10,385 --> 01:07:16,054
If we did that study, we could also add another arm to that study or a group

574
01:07:16,054 --> 01:07:21,583
and say, well, let's look at two different groups or everybody and who cramps

575
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:24,327
and doesn't cramp, then I could just take some blood

576
01:07:24,327 --> 01:07:29,495
samples and look at the differences between electrolyte and dehydration.

577
01:07:29,495 --> 01:07:31,278
And they have done those studies.

578
01:07:31,278 --> 01:07:34,081
And there is no difference.

579
01:07:34,081 --> 01:07:39,369
and when someone is severely dehydrated versus hydrated or

580
01:07:39,369 --> 01:07:43,134
not dehydrated, and the number of cramps that they're experiencing.

581
01:07:44,556 --> 01:07:51,226
In addition, they've done a lot of studies where they've electrically stimulated muscles, right?

582
01:07:51,226 --> 01:07:56,778
Very similar to something you might see at like a, maybe at like a,

583
01:07:56,778 --> 01:07:58,721
I don't know, physical therapy clinic where they're putting

584
01:07:58,721 --> 01:08:01,244
on some electrodes and they stimulate the muscle.

585
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:03,788
Well, they do that at a much higher current and frequency

586
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:10,718
and they see at what point in time will someone start cramping and then look at some of these factors.

587
01:08:10,718 --> 01:08:14,924
And they have not found anything associated with electrolytes.

588
01:08:17,207 --> 01:08:24,878
Another issue would be where are electrolytes in the blood distributed?

589
01:08:31,456 --> 01:08:32,517
Do you have blood everywhere?

590
01:08:34,019 --> 01:08:34,620
Yeah.

591
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,462
Where do you normally have a cramp?

592
01:08:36,462 --> 01:08:37,143
Your whole body?

593
01:08:38,305 --> 01:08:41,028
When you're dehydrated, yeah, like one single muscle.

594
01:08:41,028 --> 01:08:43,691
When you're dehydrated, are you just dehydrated in that muscle?

595
01:08:44,853 --> 01:08:49,539
No, your whole body's dehydrated, but we don't just go into a full body cramp, right?

596
01:08:49,539 --> 01:08:51,401
And same thing with electrolytes.

597
01:08:51,401 --> 01:08:52,302
They've measured those.

598
01:08:52,302 --> 01:08:54,285
They've changed those concentrations.

599
01:08:55,166 --> 01:09:00,312
And that systemic kind of blood concentration of these electrolytes aren't really causing issues.

600
01:09:00,312 --> 01:09:03,798
In addition, what if I get a cramp or you see

601
01:09:03,798 --> 01:09:06,763
on television an athlete having a cramp, what's the first thing

602
01:09:06,763 --> 01:09:09,668
you see maybe the athletic trainer trying to help out with?

603
01:09:11,311 --> 01:09:11,892
Does anyone know?

604
01:09:13,455 --> 01:09:14,176
Yeah.

605
01:09:14,176 --> 01:09:16,721
They'll try to stretch it or maybe massage it.

606
01:09:16,721 --> 01:09:22,418
And if you've had a cramp, do you feel like massaging and stretching sometimes helps?

607
01:09:22,418 --> 01:09:25,922
Probably most of you would agree that, yeah, some

608
01:09:25,922 --> 01:09:29,586
sort of manipulation of that area, physical manipulation of that

609
01:09:29,586 --> 01:09:32,649
area does help, whether it's massaging or stretching.

610
01:09:35,973 --> 01:09:38,276
I'm not saying that it's impossible, but as of right

611
01:09:38,276 --> 01:09:47,866
now, we don't have any evidence to support this dehydration electrolyte theory in muscle cramps.

612
01:09:47,866 --> 01:09:48,527
Why are, what do electrolytes do?

613
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:56,048
Yeah, that's where the debate comes, where some would

614
01:09:56,048 --> 01:10:02,643
argue that there are large industry groups that are promoting something to make sales.

615
01:10:03,444 --> 01:10:07,694
But I don't want to introduce that piece.

616
01:10:07,694 --> 01:10:13,581
The other thing though is electrolytes are very important, not necessarily for cramping though.

617
01:10:13,581 --> 01:10:16,185
If I go out and I don't have some type

618
01:10:16,185 --> 01:10:23,614
of solution that is replacing electrolytes and carbohydrates and fluid,

619
01:10:23,614 --> 01:10:27,999
I'm gonna run into a lot of issues, especially with dehydration, right?

620
01:10:27,999 --> 01:10:32,104
So that's a separate issue as far as from

621
01:10:32,104 --> 01:10:35,929
a thermoregulatory standpoint, but not a cramping standpoint.

622
01:10:37,192 --> 01:10:39,096
So then the next question should be, well, if

623
01:10:39,096 --> 01:10:45,147
it's not the electrolyte theory, electrolyte dehydration theory, what else can we look at?

624
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:50,757
Well, to date, the altered neuromuscular control theory is

625
01:10:50,757 --> 01:10:58,592
the only one where we have substantial evidence supporting the contribution of this theory and cramps.

626
01:10:59,399 --> 01:11:03,188
So there's an abnormal spinal reflex activity due to fatigue.

627
01:11:04,049 --> 01:11:07,537
This results in increased excitatory activity of the muscle

628
01:11:07,537 --> 01:11:12,789
spindles and a reduction in the inhibitory effect of the Golgi tendon organ.

629
01:11:13,972 --> 01:11:16,918
Whoa, muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organ.

630
01:11:16,918 --> 01:11:19,193
You probably haven't heard of those.

631
01:11:19,193 --> 01:11:20,776
in a long time.

632
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:21,558
So let's look at this.

633
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:26,048
If we have increased muscle spindle activity, the muscle

634
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:30,999
spindles, their goal is to detect stretches in the muscle.

635
01:11:32,482 --> 01:11:38,549
The sensory neurons conduct action potentials in the spinal cord, and that helps with

636
01:11:38,549 --> 01:11:42,655
the muscle to contract and resist being stretched.

637
01:11:42,655 --> 01:11:45,059
So if you stretch your muscle too much, the muscle

638
01:11:45,059 --> 01:11:47,522
spindle is basically like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, too much.

639
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:51,648
We don't wanna cause damage, so we wanna activate and kind

640
01:11:51,648 --> 01:11:54,132
of get it to come back, not to stretch it too much.

641
01:11:55,534 --> 01:12:00,421
That means in this theory, there's just an increase in this activity.

642
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:04,567
If you increase this activity, it's gonna cause additional

643
01:12:04,567 --> 01:12:07,071
contractions when you don't really want it.

644
01:12:08,384 --> 01:12:14,730
In a lot of animal models, yeah.

645
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:18,354
Well, yeah, and so those are very similar to this

646
01:12:18,354 --> 01:12:21,957
piece where they think there's an overactivation of something.

647
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:26,782
One of those somethings would be the muscle spindle.

648
01:12:26,782 --> 01:12:35,671
So in many animal models, they've induced cramps and they cut this signal and the cramps go away.

649
01:12:35,671 --> 01:12:36,813
which kind of makes sense, right?

650
01:12:36,813 --> 01:12:45,426
If I cut that neuron and I sever the connection, then there's nothing telling it to over-activate.

651
01:12:45,426 --> 01:12:47,349
And then on the flip side, if you stimulate the

652
01:12:47,349 --> 01:12:52,317
muscle spindles excessively, you induce a cramp, yeah.

653
01:12:52,317 --> 01:12:57,364
And then on the flip side to the muscle spindle, the Golgi tendon organ activity decreases.

654
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:03,076
So the Golgi tendon organ detects tension when applied to a tendon.

655
01:13:03,076 --> 01:13:06,700
Inhibition of the alpha motor neuron causes muscle

656
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:10,564
relaxation, relieving the tension applied to the tendon.

657
01:13:11,725 --> 01:13:14,748
So this is if I have too much, then you get

658
01:13:14,748 --> 01:13:19,613
this inhibitory action of the goldie tendon organ to try to get the muscle to relax.

659
01:13:20,454 --> 01:13:24,298
If you decrease that inhibitory action, you are going

660
01:13:24,298 --> 01:13:26,880
to increase the chances of getting a contraction.

661
01:13:28,402 --> 01:13:30,484
So the two are kind of in play here.

662
01:13:33,721 --> 01:13:40,916
Okay, now that I've probably caused some tension here with

663
