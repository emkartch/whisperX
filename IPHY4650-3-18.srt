1
00:02:16,516 --> 00:02:17,137
All right.

2
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,382
Welcome back, everyone.

3
00:02:20,382 --> 00:02:23,567
I hope you had a good weekend.

4
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:28,234
We are gonna get started with the next unit.

5
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:34,624
So just as a reminder, chapters physiology of training, 13, 14,

6
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:38,610
and 20 will not be on your exam on Thursday.

7
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,075
So it's just eight through 11.

8
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,777
We okay with that?

9
00:02:45,777 --> 00:02:48,962
But I have to go through this or else we're gonna fall way behind.

10
00:02:48,962 --> 00:02:53,390
So originally this was supposed to be on your second exam,

11
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,495
but I wanted to make sure to take some time through the

12
00:02:56,495 --> 00:03:01,744
other materials and give you some time to study for that chapter 11.

13
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:09,097
So that's why we're pushing this material to the final.

14
00:03:09,097 --> 00:03:10,840
Any questions on that?

15
00:03:12,035 --> 00:03:15,020
Okay, cool, so this is the Physiology of Training.

16
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,566
It starts to, all of it's pretty fun in my opinion,

17
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:24,055
but it starts to all come together where we can start applying this maybe to training principles.

18
00:03:25,658 --> 00:03:28,322
So we'll start with that concept, training principles.

19
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:30,841
or principles of training.

20
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:33,024
Then we'll go to the physiological effects of

21
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:39,153
endurance training, detraining following endurance training.

22
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:43,739
And then links between muscle and systemic physiology.

23
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,745
We'll talk a little bit about resistance training or strength training.

24
00:03:47,745 --> 00:03:52,912
And then some interesting things with detraining in resistance training as well.

25
00:03:52,912 --> 00:03:57,599
And then concurrent strength and endurance training.

26
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,001
So sometimes,

27
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:05,346
There's this idea, and we'll show some mechanisms, that if you do both strain training

28
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:08,951
and you do endurance training at the same time,

29
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:12,155
that that could potentially have some interactions going on.

30
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:18,883
And then some common training mistakes that we'll kind of discuss very briefly.

31
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:24,614
Okay, so principles of training.

32
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:26,200
What are the principles of training?

33
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:33,004
No surprise, in order to have some type of adaptation, you need to overload the system.

34
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:36,497
You need to stress the body in some way so the body adapts.

35
00:04:37,405 --> 00:04:39,950
That is this concept of overload.

36
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,795
So this is an increased capacity of a system in response

37
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:46,341
to training above the level of which it is accustomed to.

38
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:49,888
So if I am stressing the body beyond what you do

39
00:04:49,888 --> 00:04:55,498
on a normal basis, the body will make adaptations in order to

40
00:04:55,498 --> 00:04:59,565
try to deal with that same stress again at another time.

41
00:05:01,553 --> 00:05:06,117
We can alter the different, I guess, control systems as

42
00:05:06,117 --> 00:05:10,382
far as like am I altering intensity, duration, and frequency.

43
00:05:12,624 --> 00:05:16,728
Most of the time, they are very commonly linked.

44
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:22,413
If you are training at a high intensity, by default, your duration will always come down.

45
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:27,258
But you can imagine that I could do something like

46
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:31,122
heavy exercise and I can vary the duration quite easily.

47
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:34,057
And then frequency is the same deal.

48
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,363
So typically, on this graph over here, on the x-axis, we have time.

49
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:42,185
On the y, we have performance.

50
00:05:42,185 --> 00:05:46,029
So as we are going up on the y-axis, we are improving in performance.

51
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:55,217
When we have one training bout, we see a temporary or an acute dip in performance.

52
00:05:55,217 --> 00:05:58,601
But then that comes back up because our body is making some adaptations.

53
00:06:01,023 --> 00:06:02,104
Over time,

54
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:09,898
If this time over here is weeks or months, this decrement will then come up.

55
00:06:11,881 --> 00:06:15,166
And then you'll apply some stress or you'll overload the system.

56
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,128
It'll come back down.

57
00:06:16,128 --> 00:06:20,254
You'll recover, overload, recover, overload, recover.

58
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:25,662
And as time progresses, you will see an improvement in performance.

59
00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:33,769
Now there's two kind of pieces to this where we need to be careful about.

60
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:39,958
One, if you train too much, or if you stop training.

61
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:46,228
If you do either of those things, then you can experience reversibility.

62
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:49,012
So you can reverse some of the gains that you've now experienced.

63
00:06:50,154 --> 00:06:53,259
So when training is stopped, the effect is quickly lost.

64
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,146
The body's actually really good at conserving energy.

65
00:06:59,324 --> 00:07:04,551
If you make all these adaptations to deal with extra stress and then you never apply

66
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:07,475
that stress anymore, the body's gonna be like, okay, cool, now

67
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:11,801
I don't have to spend the energy to keep these things alive and we'll go ahead and rotate this off.

68
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:15,606
And so this is the same concept that we saw

69
00:07:15,606 --> 00:07:22,715
before in blue as you progressively overload the system and increase in performance.

70
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:28,315
However, if you stop training in this black, dark line right here,

71
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:32,182
no surprise that your fitness level will start to decrease.

72
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:40,316
The concerning piece to this graph is if you are

73
00:07:40,316 --> 00:07:47,452
seeing improvements in performance, most tend to think, well, if I

74
00:07:47,452 --> 00:07:50,759
and gaining these performances with this type of stress, the

75
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:57,154
only way I can improve even more would be to apply more stress and overload the body even more.

76
00:07:58,216 --> 00:08:00,201
But we need to be careful with that because now

77
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:06,675
you're not giving yourself enough recovery time and you start to trend downwards.

78
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:11,902
And we'll talk about overtraining syndrome a little bit later in the semester,

79
00:08:11,902 --> 00:08:15,390
but this is a serious issue where a lot of elite

80
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:20,813
endurance athletes are just maybe people who are engaging in exercise.

81
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:25,781
very frequently at high intensities, they'll start to see a decrease in their performance

82
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:33,253
and it becomes very problematic as far as on an individual's mental ability,

83
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:35,636
or not ability, but just their mentality on things

84
00:08:35,636 --> 00:08:38,220
because they're like, well, I don't understand why I'm not

85
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,447
getting better when I'm training all the time and training even harder.

86
00:08:42,447 --> 00:08:46,372
And so sometimes they are experiencing this overtraining syndrome.

87
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:51,479
And depending on how severe it gets, you can even get pretty severe down here.

88
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:53,422
And it takes years to recover from.

89
00:08:54,523 --> 00:08:56,526
Most of the time, it doesn't take that long.

90
00:08:56,526 --> 00:09:00,431
But if it becomes that severe, sometimes you'll see

91
00:09:00,431 --> 00:09:07,240
athletes on the highest Olympic caliber athletes where they'll need years to recover from some of this.

92
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:12,478
But we'll get into overtraining syndrome a little bit later.

93
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:16,803
But just know that if you apply an appropriate amount

94
00:09:16,803 --> 00:09:19,647
of overload with an appropriate amount of recovery, we

95
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:23,892
will see this progressive overload and an improvement in performance.

96
00:09:23,892 --> 00:09:27,898
If you stop this progressive overload, then you'll see a decrease in performance.

97
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:35,407
If you don't let the body recover enough, then

98
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:39,032
you could potentially see this overtraining where you see a decrease in performance.

99
00:09:43,113 --> 00:09:44,115
Any questions on this?

100
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:48,281
Okay.

101
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:50,405
Specificity is another principle of training.

102
00:09:51,346 --> 00:09:57,677
This is basically saying, if I am a runner, I probably

103
00:09:57,677 --> 00:10:03,515
want to train the muscles and the movement involved in running to get better at running.

104
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:06,338
I think we all are pretty familiar with this.

105
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:07,760
Some of them do cross over.

106
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,807
If I am a cyclist, I might not be the best runner, but

107
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:19,594
it might take less time for me to become a very successful runner than if I'm sedentary.

108
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,120
So there's some crossover, but specificity is really important.

109
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,683
We need to train the muscles and the type of movements

110
00:10:26,683 --> 00:10:33,471
and the activities that we are trying to be applying that to the given race.

111
00:10:43,762 --> 00:10:47,106
Okay, with the data that we do have right now, it

112
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:50,831
appears that men and women do respond similarly to training programs.

113
00:10:51,672 --> 00:10:56,518
However, exercise prescriptions should be individualized, although it is very hard to do.

114
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,265
In the American College of Sports Medicine, if you look at any other training programs,

115
00:11:01,265 --> 00:11:05,370
it's like, oh, three to five days a week, maybe around 50

116
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:09,665
to 60% of your VO2 max and try to do that for an hour a day.

117
00:11:09,665 --> 00:11:12,909
that is very broad and that will help everyone.

118
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:16,332
But if you are primarily trying to improve performance,

119
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:19,316
there's a lot of individual variability and we should probably

120
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:26,304
try and make things a little bit more individualized to

121
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:30,288
certain groups as opposed to just saying everybody must adhere to

122
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:32,130
this training program if you want to get better.

123
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:38,237
Okay, what about

124
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,529
pre-existing fitness level.

125
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:50,740
So your initial fitness level does impact the percent gain that I might experience after training.

126
00:11:52,783 --> 00:11:54,945
So if we look at this figure here, we have

127
00:11:54,945 --> 00:12:00,793
three groups, sedentary, active, and trained, and we have VO2 max

128
00:12:00,793 --> 00:12:03,516
as a relative component here on the Y axis.

129
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:10,660
Sedentary individuals, they start typically at a lower VO2 max.

130
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,186
And so when they go through training, they have a larger relative increase.

131
00:12:14,186 --> 00:12:17,651
They have a 50% increase in this example.

132
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:23,379
That increase is much smaller as we get to individuals who are more fit.

133
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:28,792
So active individuals, because they start at a higher initial baseline VO2,

134
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:30,675
they only get maybe like a 20% increase.

135
00:12:31,476 --> 00:12:34,741
And then for trained individuals, it's actually really,

136
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:38,426
really hard to improve your maximum aerobic capacity.

137
00:12:39,607 --> 00:12:43,433
And so 5% is probably generous, but that wouldn't be out

138
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:47,138
of the ordinary if we saw a 5% increase in someone who

139
00:12:47,138 --> 00:12:50,103
was even like a collegiate athlete or a sub-elite athlete.

140
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:56,787
So it is possible to increase maximum aerobic fitness,

141
00:12:56,787 --> 00:13:07,599
But the relative change does depend on the initial fitness level.

142
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:15,648
Yeah.

143
00:13:15,648 --> 00:13:20,854
Yeah.

144
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:26,926
Yeah, and so I think there's a big debate on this, where

145
00:13:26,926 --> 00:13:31,917
they used to say, OK, we should no longer use VO2 max, we just need to use VO2 peak.

146
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:33,640
And so there was like, maybe this is your peak

147
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,807
performance, but we'll never actually know what someone's max is, because

148
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:42,738
how do I know I can't apply the correct stressors to get that individual max?

149
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:46,523
The short answer is we don't really know, besides like, OK,

150
00:13:46,523 --> 00:13:49,707
what are you doing on a normal basis, and how long have you been doing that?

151
00:13:49,707 --> 00:13:52,590
So if I can put you in one of these categories,

152
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,253
or sometimes we can expand this to like five different

153
00:13:55,253 --> 00:14:01,821
categories, then it'll be a better indication of maybe how much room that person has to grow.

154
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:03,143
Yeah, that's a really good question.

155
00:14:07,544 --> 00:14:12,292
The other problem with trying to see how much we can grow is genetics.

156
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:14,936
So there's a large influence of genetics.

157
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:21,326
And this should not be super surprising here, but this is a pretty cool study

158
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:24,311
where they looked at the increase in VO2 max for one twin,

159
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:28,438
so it was a twin study, compared to the increase in VO2 max for another twin.

160
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:36,572
And 10 pairs of identical twins, they did have an increase in VO2 max.

161
00:14:36,572 --> 00:14:39,817
And they did have it relatively linearly.

162
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:41,739
And if you look at the R here, it's 0.82.

163
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:43,902
So the R squared's around 6.6.

164
00:14:43,902 --> 00:14:46,366
So it's about 60% of the variation.

165
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:53,496
And the improvements in VO2 max due to training are potentially from genetics here.

166
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:56,721
That's kind of what this is telling me.

167
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,185
That's 40% that we're not really accounting for.

168
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:06,878
So it's not only genetics, but genetics does play a

169
00:15:06,878 --> 00:15:12,972
relatively large role in how an individual can become trained or not trained.

170
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:21,806
They have kind of labeled the influence of genetics on this genotyping.

171
00:15:21,806 --> 00:15:24,450
And it's not maybe the same genotyping that you would kind

172
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,415
of expect as far as like a particular gene.

173
00:15:27,415 --> 00:15:30,199
But they have these different genotypes here.

174
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:34,065
And they took these different individuals and had them train for about 30 months.

175
00:15:35,347 --> 00:15:37,571
And they looked at the improvements in VO2max.

176
00:15:38,953 --> 00:15:43,580
One of the biggest things they found is their baseline VO2max

177
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,464
was different between all sedentary individuals.

178
00:15:47,464 --> 00:15:50,847
So these are individuals who were not active.

179
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:54,930
And you took their baseline VO2 Maxis and they were all a little bit different.

180
00:15:56,212 --> 00:16:01,617
And it looks like there are some non-responders and there are some very strong responders.

181
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:10,785
And this is where this comes into play where it's like, okay, well, maybe it's,

182
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:17,601
how you were born that's going to determine maybe what

183
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,184
sport you might be a little bit more successful at.

184
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:27,513
And so some of the high responders genotype E possess a relatively high untrained VO2 max.

185
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:37,698
And if you thought about this, some of these things do make sense.

186
00:16:37,698 --> 00:16:42,345
If I was just born with larger lungs and a larger heart, and I was a little bit taller

187
00:16:42,345 --> 00:16:46,832
and I had more blood volume, then I'd probably have a little bit more to grow,

188
00:16:46,832 --> 00:16:49,776
and so the absolute kind of VO2 max that I

189
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:53,762
could potentially achieve would be much higher compared to if I

190
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:57,568
had a smaller heart, smaller lungs, and so forth.

191
00:16:57,568 --> 00:17:00,292
So that's kind of what this is getting at here, this genotyping.

192
00:17:01,433 --> 00:17:03,857
So some people can really

193
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:10,965
have more of the ideal genetic makeup to help their success in a particular endurance event.

194
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:21,419
So with that aerobic or anaerobic capacity is more genetically determined than aerobic capacity.

195
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:26,766
So we said VO2 max in particular, that's maybe accounting for 64% of the variability.

196
00:17:28,128 --> 00:17:31,633
Well, resistance training or

197
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:37,727
anaerobic type of events, maybe it's Olympic weight lifting

198
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:41,395
or some of the shorter sprints, those have a lot more of

199
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:46,886
a genetic component to it as far as an individual's ability to be successful.

200
00:17:46,886 --> 00:17:53,821
And if you've taken biomechanics, even the insertion of a muscle on the bone

201
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:57,667
If the distance is changing from the joint, that could

202
00:17:57,667 --> 00:18:03,436
make a very, very large change in the amount of leverage you can generate from that muscle.

203
00:18:03,436 --> 00:18:05,760
And so even though the muscle is generating the same

204
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,188
amount of force, depending on where it inserts on the bone, well, you have more or less leverage.

205
00:18:12,113 --> 00:18:17,842
So I would say this does kind of check off where the anaerobic capacity

206
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:20,507
or your ability to do some of these short

207
00:18:20,507 --> 00:18:28,099
duration high intensity exercises are more genetically determined than the endurance capacity.

208
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:36,433
Type two fibers have been theorized to be a very large component of this as well.

209
00:18:40,649 --> 00:18:43,514
So then there's this very famous quote here, if you

210
00:18:43,514 --> 00:18:48,563
want to become a world-class athlete, you must choose your parents wisely, right?

211
00:18:48,563 --> 00:18:50,426
Obviously, you can't choose your parents, but I think you

212
00:18:50,426 --> 00:18:56,597
understand what they are trying to say, so.

213
00:18:56,597 --> 00:18:56,697
Okay.

214
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:02,387
Physiological effects of endurance training.

215
00:19:05,641 --> 00:19:09,849
So we kind of looked at a few of these tests, mainly

216
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:15,619
running economy and VO2 max, but there are a few other things that we touched on.

217
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:18,885
One would be the ventilatory threshold or lactate threshold.

218
00:19:18,885 --> 00:19:23,753
The one concept that we have not talked about or will not talk about is critical power.

219
00:19:23,753 --> 00:19:27,460
That's another piece that's really important in performance.

220
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,906
And that kind of ties in as well with like VO2 kinetics.

221
00:19:30,906 --> 00:19:32,950
And so that's one piece that we don't really talk about.

222
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,398
That's a little bit more for advanced exercise phys, but there are multiple components.

223
00:19:37,398 --> 00:19:43,289
And I think I mentioned no one individual, not no, but very few individuals have

224
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:45,572
Great values for all of these.

225
00:19:45,572 --> 00:19:47,614
Most have maybe two of them.

226
00:19:47,614 --> 00:19:50,878
And then they end up being very successful in their professional athletes.

227
00:19:50,878 --> 00:19:53,841
And then if you have all four or all three, then

228
00:19:53,841 --> 00:20:00,569
we would say those are the ones that every Olympic you're seeing them kind of perform at a high level.

229
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:05,054
So just because you don't have a high VO2 max does

230
00:20:05,054 --> 00:20:08,478
not mean you can never become a successful endurance athlete.

231
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:13,043
Maybe you have a better running economy and a higher lactate threshold.

232
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,014
Some adaptations in the muscle.

233
00:20:21,877 --> 00:20:25,582
If you had this repeated overload, repeated excitation and

234
00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:29,207
contraction of the muscle fibers during endurance training, that

235
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:33,854
will stimulate the body to make some adaptations.

236
00:20:35,537 --> 00:20:39,182
Some of the main adaptations that we'll talk about

237
00:20:39,182 --> 00:20:44,650
would be muscle fiber type, capillary density, myoglobin content, and mitochondrial function.

238
00:20:46,503 --> 00:20:50,050
All right, so let's talk about this first one then, muscle fiber type.

239
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:55,982
If we are talking about endurance training, we typically are

240
00:20:55,982 --> 00:21:02,054
seeing the shift from fast to slow fibers or muscle fiber types.

241
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:03,938
And it's not necessarily saying,

242
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:09,026
we are eliminating a certain muscle fiber type.

243
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:13,110
That's not what we're talking about or even gaining a certain muscle fiber type.

244
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:17,334
This is saying a reduction in the cross-sectional area for

245
00:21:17,334 --> 00:21:23,240
the fast fibers and an increase in the cross-sectional area for the slow fibers.

246
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,044
So you are adding those sarcomeres in parallel to make

247
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:30,668
the muscle fiber, the single muscle fiber a little bit bigger.

248
00:21:34,175 --> 00:21:39,088
The magnitude of the change is determined by the type of training that you are doing.

249
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,346
And if you remember, we briefly talked about this in

250
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:48,811
chapter 8 with muscle physiology, but there are these hybrid types.

251
00:21:48,811 --> 00:21:54,279
So sometimes there's a type 1, type 2a, type 2a, type 2x.

252
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,362
You don't need to know this, but just know there is

253
00:21:56,362 --> 00:22:01,589
this kind of shift where they start to become, you see some hybrid fiber types.

254
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:06,696
But in general, you're increasing the cross-sectional area of the fiber type of interest.

255
00:22:15,721 --> 00:22:17,102
All right.

256
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,964
Capillary density would be the next one.

257
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:22,448
So we see an increase in the number of capillaries surrounding the muscle fibers.

258
00:22:23,949 --> 00:22:27,413
This should also track with everything that we talked about.

259
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:31,316
If I can deliver more blood to the tissues, well, that means

260
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:34,880
more oxygen is going to be able to be delivered to those tissues.

261
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,922
And so the best way to do that would be to

262
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:40,185
increase the number of capillaries that are surrounding those muscle fibers.

263
00:22:41,286 --> 00:22:45,070
So it's going to enhance diffusion of oxygen and improve the removal of waste.

264
00:22:46,012 --> 00:22:50,984
This table 11.2 down here, if you decided to ignore it, that's OK with me.

265
00:22:50,984 --> 00:22:54,372
This is just something to show as far as

266
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:57,118
the number of capillaries increasing, the capillary density.

267
00:22:59,326 --> 00:23:02,211
So the one way, so someone might ask, OK, well,

268
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:05,957
if I'm just increasing the number of capillaries, yeah, I'm sending more blood.

269
00:23:05,957 --> 00:23:09,924
But the other thing that does is if you send the same amount of blood,

270
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,989
but now you have more capillaries for the blood to

271
00:23:12,989 --> 00:23:16,876
spread out, you are slowing down the blood that's kind of

272
00:23:18,338 --> 00:23:22,245
flowing past the muscle fibers and allows for a better diffusion time.

273
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:27,060
So you're increasing the time it takes for the blood to

274
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,745
move across the muscle bed because now you have all these

275
00:23:29,745 --> 00:23:33,793
capillaries that are distributing the blood in a better way.

276
00:23:35,295 --> 00:23:42,998
And then it also, not in a big piece, but it could potentially change the diffusion distance if

277
00:23:42,998 --> 00:23:44,040
This is not what happens.

278
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,283
But if you only had muscle fibers on the top of,

279
00:23:46,283 --> 00:23:48,928
or capillaries on the top of the muscle fiber, then it would

280
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,612
be really hard to diffuse the oxygen all the way to the bottom.

281
00:23:51,612 --> 00:23:55,839
And so if you surround it, then it's a little bit easier for the oxygen to get through.

282
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,685
That's not exactly what happens, but that's a good way to kind of think of it.

283
00:24:06,396 --> 00:24:07,538
Any questions on this one?

284
00:24:11,197 --> 00:24:17,788
Myoglobin content, endurance training increases muscle myoglobin by approximately 70 to 80%.

285
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:23,819
This then helps increase the O2 reserve in the muscles,

286
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:29,188
but it also supports a muscle's increased capacity for oxidative metabolism after training.

287
00:24:30,265 --> 00:24:32,752
So after I train, if I'm increasing the number of

288
00:24:32,752 --> 00:24:36,802
myoglobin, well now the hemoglobin molecules can drop off more

289
00:24:36,802 --> 00:24:40,291
oxygen to the muscles and they have somewhere to go, right?

290
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:44,663
They're going to the myoglobin so the myoglobin can pick it up and deliver it to the mitochondria.

291
00:24:54,768 --> 00:25:00,115
All right, muscle mitochondria, those also increase or change.

292
00:25:00,936 --> 00:25:02,378
We'll start with the time course.

293
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,343
It's relatively quick.

294
00:25:06,343 --> 00:25:08,286
It's not the fastest thing that changes.

295
00:25:09,327 --> 00:25:12,211
But within five weeks, so about a month of training,

296
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:17,738
we can see almost a doubling in the mitochondrial density.

297
00:25:20,148 --> 00:25:22,532
And so we can say that it's pretty like the

298
00:25:22,532 --> 00:25:25,737
plasticity of mitochondrial density changes is quite high.

299
00:25:31,286 --> 00:25:36,094
So you might be thinking like, OK, where are these mitochondria changing?

300
00:25:36,094 --> 00:25:41,763
And if you remember again from chapter 8, we have two locations for muscle mitochondria.

301
00:25:41,763 --> 00:25:44,788
We have the subcircle lemma, or the SS, and then we have the IMF.

302
00:25:46,692 --> 00:25:50,518
So in between the muscle fibers and then kind of on top of the muscle fibers.

303
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:57,788
Same deal, if we have increase in the number or

304
00:25:57,788 --> 00:26:01,854
the volume of mitochondria, that's gonna help our oxidative capacity.

305
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:06,121
And that's also going to help us utilize fat as a fuel source.

306
00:26:10,347 --> 00:26:15,855
With training, we also see an increased turnover rate of mitochondria.

307
00:26:17,017 --> 00:26:19,400
And this is a good thing because we want our

308
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:25,509
mitochondria to be functioning at a high efficiency or a good rate.

309
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:27,852
And so any time we have damaged mitochondria, if

310
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:32,259
the turnover is high, we're not really experiencing any of those problems.

311
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:36,725
And so that happens when we are undergoing consistent training for long periods of time.

312
00:26:38,287 --> 00:26:43,935
If we talk about the breakdown of damaged mitochondria, mitophagy would be the term.

313
00:26:46,362 --> 00:26:48,205
And you don't need to know this, but sometimes the

314
00:26:48,205 --> 00:26:51,230
free radicals or the free radical productions or the electrons

315
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:58,001
are causing damage to the cytochromes, and sometimes you can get some damage in the mitochondria.

316
00:26:58,001 --> 00:26:59,323
So it's nice to turn those over.

317
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:07,196
Okay, so if we're increasing the number here, so the

318
00:27:07,196 --> 00:27:12,825
density, the next piece would be talking about maybe the size of each individual mitochondria.

319
00:27:14,206 --> 00:27:19,674
If we increase the volume of the mitochondria, that just

320
00:27:19,674 --> 00:27:28,788
means you're able to kind of spread out the workload a little bit easier for that particular mitochondria.

321
00:27:28,788 --> 00:27:30,250
The density also does that, right?

322
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,494
If you have two things doing the same thing, well,

323
00:27:32,494 --> 00:27:37,862
now you can maybe split the workload between the two mitochondria to produce the same amount of ATP.

324
00:27:37,862 --> 00:27:41,968
That same concept happens here, where it can handle

325
00:27:42,843 --> 00:27:46,668
Like different portions or areas of the mitochondria can handle

326
00:27:46,668 --> 00:27:50,974
maybe units of ADP, so then you can get the same amount of oxygen consumption.

327
00:27:52,956 --> 00:27:57,722
So instead of making the individual pieces of the mitochondria

328
00:27:57,722 --> 00:28:04,992
work harder, you now can spread out the work amongst one mitochondria if the volume gets bigger.

329
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:09,137
And then if you increase in density, you're spreading it across multiple mitochondria.

330
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:16,146
Increase in mitochondria volume also decreases cytosolic ADP

331
00:28:16,146 --> 00:28:18,749
concentrations due to increased ADP transporters.

332
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:25,458
If you can do that, if you can increase the number of ADP concentration

333
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:28,882
or change the ADP concentration, then you are

334
00:28:28,882 --> 00:28:34,669
encouraging oxidative phosphorylation inside of the mitochondria.

335
00:28:42,648 --> 00:28:50,407
OK, all of these things are nice to see, especially they're going to improve, say, VO2 max.

336
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:52,925
They're also going to improve

337
00:28:52,925 --> 00:28:57,472
some of the kinetics that are involved with submaximal exercise.

338
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,896
And we see this with the O2 deficit.

339
00:28:59,896 --> 00:29:01,699
So if we go back one slide, sorry about that.

340
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:06,186
If we see less phosphocreatine depletion, so we're using

341
00:29:06,186 --> 00:29:12,556
less of the immediate energy stores, well that should be seen in this O2 debt shading curve.

342
00:29:12,556 --> 00:29:18,004
So like if I shaded from this teal line over to here, this O2 debt here,

343
00:29:19,165 --> 00:29:23,112
is much smaller than if I shaded from the end of this blue line all the way over.

344
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:33,250
So again, same picture, less phosphocreatine depletion.

345
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,956
O2 kinetics kind of talks about how quickly this line rises.

346
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:40,262
They're kind of saying the same thing.

347
00:29:42,976 --> 00:29:46,420
And so the faster we get the oxygen consumption to

348
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:50,104
rise, typically that's a little bit better for individuals

349
00:29:50,104 --> 00:29:55,289
who are conducting or performing some maximal exercise or endurance exercise.

350
00:30:01,255 --> 00:30:02,397
Okay, so this is great, right?

351
00:30:02,397 --> 00:30:06,181
Like we have this increase in mitochondrial density, increase in myoglobin.

352
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:09,444
We're having all these types of nice changes here.

353
00:30:09,444 --> 00:30:11,933
What are the mechanisms

354
00:30:11,933 --> 00:30:17,140
or what are the signals that the body is sending to increase all of these things?

355
00:30:19,123 --> 00:30:21,927
So this would be the exercise-induced signaling that we're seeing here.

356
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:29,497
You really just need to focus on the six secondary signaling molecules which are here.

357
00:30:32,181 --> 00:30:33,182
So this row here.

358
00:30:34,175 --> 00:30:36,718
Now, when I say that, I would not memorize these.

359
00:30:36,718 --> 00:30:37,939
You definitely can.

360
00:30:37,939 --> 00:30:44,167
But I'll tell you right now, I'm not going to say list the six secondary signaling molecules.

361
00:30:45,308 --> 00:30:48,792
I'm just saying you should focus on this piece.

362
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:51,635
And if there's one, not to memorize, but there's one to

363
00:30:51,635 --> 00:30:55,299
kind of keep in the back of your mind, would be this PGC1 alpha.

364
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:04,060
That's because a lot of these signaling molecules kind of also influence the PGC1 alpha.

365
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:07,483
But the whole point is if I increase the number

366
00:31:07,483 --> 00:31:14,229
or concentration of calcium here, the calcium in itself acts as like a myokine.

367
00:31:15,471 --> 00:31:21,276
And then it increases some type of secondary signaling molecule

368
00:31:22,557 --> 00:31:28,102
to help shift the fiber type from fast to slow or

369
00:31:28,102 --> 00:31:33,207
increase the cross-sectional area of those kind of slower fiber types or those type I fibers.

370
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:40,756
That also activates PGC1 alpha, which would do the same

371
00:31:40,756 --> 00:31:47,584
thing for this fiber type shift, but it also encourages mitochondrial biogenesis.

372
00:31:47,584 --> 00:31:50,748
So increasing the number and the density of the mitochondria.

373
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,972
And same with these ones over here.

374
00:31:53,972 --> 00:31:59,278
NF kappa beta here is going to increase the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes.

375
00:32:05,182 --> 00:32:08,287
So when we're looking at this PGC1 alpha, it's kind of

376
00:32:08,287 --> 00:32:11,192
funny, where you would think it's only like three words.

377
00:32:11,192 --> 00:32:13,155
But I don't know if you know this, but

378
00:32:13,155 --> 00:32:19,144
PGC1 alpha is paroxysome proliferator activated receptor gamma co-activator.

379
00:32:19,144 --> 00:32:20,807
That's crazy, right?

380
00:32:20,807 --> 00:32:24,212
You would think it would be a little shorter than that, but that's what PGC1 alpha is.

381
00:32:26,296 --> 00:32:29,340
You don't need to know that, but OK.

382
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,362
Any questions on this?

383
00:32:33,802 --> 00:32:37,727
Oh, and then this one here, you don't, again, it's nice

384
00:32:37,727 --> 00:32:44,815
to see these, but the AMP ATP ratio, this is just an indication that you have low ATP.

385
00:32:44,815 --> 00:32:48,619
So if you have more AMP than ATP, well, that just

386
00:32:48,619 --> 00:32:52,924
means you're converting the ATP to ADP and ADP to AMP, right?

387
00:32:52,924 --> 00:32:54,686
So you're reducing the ATP levels.

388
00:32:55,527 --> 00:32:57,562
So if you see,

389
00:32:57,562 --> 00:33:01,708
an increase in this ratio, well those are gonna send signals

390
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:04,973
to try to activate some of the things that we've just been talking about.

391
00:33:05,935 --> 00:33:07,797
And then same with the free radical production.

392
00:33:07,797 --> 00:33:09,700
If you get those free radicals produced, you're gonna

393
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:16,110
try to increase the antioxidant enzymes involved with trying to help defend against that.

394
00:33:18,588 --> 00:33:21,032
So big picture, there's some primary signaling.

395
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:22,955
You don't need to know the details of the primary

396
00:33:22,955 --> 00:33:26,601
signaling, but they lead to secondary kind of responses.

397
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:29,666
One of the big response is PGC1 alpha.

398
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:32,290
But all of them kind of together are increasing

399
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:34,814
the adaptations that we're seeing with endurance training.

400
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:39,702
OK.

401
00:33:42,652 --> 00:33:45,878
So we talked about training in itself, but it's interesting

402
00:33:45,878 --> 00:33:50,947
because if we look at this here, this AMP-ATP ratio, that's

403
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:57,078
saying if I'm low on energy, it's going to stimulate some adaptations.

404
00:33:58,421 --> 00:34:01,647
Well, that concept, when this paper came out, then you

405
00:34:01,647 --> 00:34:05,233
got a bunch of researchers and coaches kind of saying,

406
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:10,267
Well, if I can induce a low energy state and have

407
00:34:10,267 --> 00:34:16,141
my athletes train, then potentially I could get even further adaptations.

408
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:18,627
So that's why this kind of concept came in where

409
00:34:18,627 --> 00:34:25,062
you have low muscle glycogen is a positive influence on endurance training induced adaptations.

410
00:34:26,678 --> 00:34:31,368
So that decrease in that ratio, that AMP-ATP ratio,

411
00:34:31,368 --> 00:34:35,737
is going to promote increased protein synthesis and mitochondrial formation.

412
00:34:35,737 --> 00:34:40,207
And that's, again, due to higher activation of PCG1 alpha.

413
00:34:40,207 --> 00:34:43,033
And that's because of that AMP-ATP ratio.

414
00:34:44,785 --> 00:34:47,509
So this word got out, and now there's two approaches here.

415
00:34:47,509 --> 00:34:53,419
Maybe restrict dietary carbohydrates to try to reduce the energy that is available.

416
00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:55,322
One thing we have to be careful about is it's

417
00:34:55,322 --> 00:34:57,265
definitely going to cause fatigue and limit training.

418
00:34:58,106 --> 00:35:03,534
Or I can do two a days, and the second training session would have lower muscle glycogen.

419
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,157
So maybe it's going to stimulate things.

420
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:10,358
So there was this big, and it still might be

421
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:14,406
there, where sometimes there's this big idea where you would just

422
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:20,136
wake up right away, not eat anything, and then go for some type of training session.

423
00:35:20,136 --> 00:35:22,480
Yeah, you're going to feel kind of miserable and it

424
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:30,655
might limit your training, but the idea behind that is trying to increase or activate PGC 1 alpha.

425
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,092
Now that's a little bit of a double-edged sword, right?

426
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:38,197
So maybe I'm increasing protein synthesis and mitochondrial

427
00:35:38,197 --> 00:35:41,660
density, but now my workouts are suffering.

428
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:46,426
And so there is a little bit of a balance, and so I'm not saying you can't do this

429
00:35:46,426 --> 00:35:48,368
or shouldn't do this, or you should only do this,

430
00:35:48,368 --> 00:35:52,192
but eventually you need to have high-quality workout sessions.

431
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:58,819
And so, yeah, if you can sprinkle this in strategically, that it could be a good way to train.

432
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:05,597
Any questions on this concept?

433
00:36:10,266 --> 00:36:12,010
Nice.

434
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,533
I feel like most of you are like checked out, right?

435
00:36:13,533 --> 00:36:15,156
Like, it's not on this exam.

436
00:36:15,156 --> 00:36:15,958
We don't care about this.

437
00:36:18,162 --> 00:36:18,884
That's OK.

438
00:36:18,884 --> 00:36:19,605
I understand.

439
00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:20,767
I understand.

440
00:36:20,767 --> 00:36:21,901
All right.

441
00:36:21,901 --> 00:36:24,866
Effective exercise duration on muscle fuel source.

442
00:36:24,866 --> 00:36:27,109
You've already seen this, so we don't need to go through it.

443
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:30,534
But just know as you increase in exercise duration, the

444
00:36:30,534 --> 00:36:33,779
oxidation of fat or the reliance on fat starts to increase.

445
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:38,987
And that's because we're really starting to deplete some of these muscle glycogen levels.

446
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:43,814
OK, so for training, we learned that as you increase

447
00:36:43,814 --> 00:36:49,443
with duration, the training effect has this kind of like up into the left shift.

448
00:36:49,443 --> 00:36:50,845
And so we're shifting it this way.

449
00:36:53,693 --> 00:36:56,456
This should be reviewed, so I'm not gonna spend a whole lot of time on it.

450
00:36:56,456 --> 00:36:59,859
Instead, we're gonna talk about a few other details.

451
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,082
Based on what we just talked about, we saw

452
00:37:03,082 --> 00:37:07,086
that endurance exercise training increases capillary density and

453
00:37:07,086 --> 00:37:11,170
also increases the mitochondrial density and size, right?

454
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,992
The number of mitochondria as well as the size.

455
00:37:13,993 --> 00:37:18,958
All of those things are going to improve your ability to kind of

456
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:23,296
like utilize some of these substrates.

457
00:37:23,296 --> 00:37:25,681
In particular, capillary density is going to slow down the

458
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:30,610
blood flow in the muscles and increase the number of free fatty acid transporters.

459
00:37:31,492 --> 00:37:35,780
That's going to allow for the muscles to take up more free fatty acids.

460
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,882
and then utilize them more.

461
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:40,545
But we can't just utilize them more, because if I deliver

462
00:37:40,545 --> 00:37:45,009
more free fatty acids, they need to have maybe more mitochondria.

463
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:49,914
Well, nice thing about this is we do have that increased number in mitochondria.

464
00:37:49,914 --> 00:37:55,780
We also have this kind of increase in beta oxidation and the enzymes involved in beta oxidation.

465
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:03,508
All of this is going to help spare some of the glucose, plasma glucose.

466
00:38:06,003 --> 00:38:08,807
So that's why we're shifting things up into the left.

467
00:38:08,807 --> 00:38:11,391
And if you shift that up into the left, then that

468
00:38:11,391 --> 00:38:15,678
means carbohydrates are going down, which is a good thing for endurance exercise.

469
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,687
OK, what about the acid-base balance?

470
00:38:21,687 --> 00:38:24,831
We've talked about kind of this concept of acid-base balance in chapter 11.

471
00:38:24,831 --> 00:38:28,978
Well, if we increase the number of mitochondria and we

472
00:38:28,978 --> 00:38:35,399
can increase the free fatty acid oxidation, we're going to decrease PFK activity.

473
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,322
Well, that's kind of nice, because maybe we're going

474
00:38:37,322 --> 00:38:42,111
to decrease pyruvate formation and form less lactate.

475
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:46,198
And potentially, we're going to help reduce some of the hydrogen formation.

476
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,467
This piece here, I wouldn't worry about it too much, but H4.

477
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:55,302
So this is that lactate dehydrogenase.

478
00:38:55,302 --> 00:38:56,043
There's an enzyme.

479
00:38:56,924 --> 00:38:59,267
And there's just a different isoform that kind of

480
00:38:59,267 --> 00:39:05,635
encourages the formation of pyruvate as opposed to the formation of lactate, for example.

481
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:14,586
All of that is going to help maintain some of that blood pH and that muscle pH as well.

482
00:39:19,763 --> 00:39:26,369
So if we're decreasing the lactate that is being formed, no surprise that

483
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:29,673
when we do a lactate test, we see the kind

484
00:39:29,673 --> 00:39:35,418
of rate of appearance versus rate of disappearance, that fluctuation happened at a much higher intensity.

485
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,481
So that's why we get this shift to the

486
00:39:38,481 --> 00:39:45,788
right with lactate threshold in trained individuals compared to the untrained individuals.

487
00:39:54,475 --> 00:40:01,643
Hopefully this is a lot of review here and you're not thinking that this is brand new information.

488
00:40:01,643 --> 00:40:03,405
We're just kinda putting things together a little bit.

489
00:40:07,469 --> 00:40:09,972
Okay, cardiovascular adaptations to training.

490
00:40:11,574 --> 00:40:17,040
We get multiple cardiovascular adaptations during endurance training.

491
00:40:18,342 --> 00:40:24,128
Maximal cardiac output, heart size, heart rate, stroke volume, blood volume, and AVO2 difference.

492
00:40:24,935 --> 00:40:26,878
We're going to kind of walk through some of these things here.

493
00:40:30,664 --> 00:40:34,730
You've probably seen the range of VO2 max between

494
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:40,399
maybe untrained and trained individuals between sex, and this is just a reminder here.

495
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:49,437
This is not necessarily for you to memorize, but it is nice to know that on average the

496
00:40:49,437 --> 00:40:51,661
for different groups.

497
00:40:51,661 --> 00:40:55,647
You have women who are kind of lower on average than men.

498
00:40:55,647 --> 00:41:01,276
Obviously, there are some women who are higher than males,

499
00:41:01,276 --> 00:41:06,524
but in general, the men are usually on average a little bit higher than the women.

500
00:41:06,524 --> 00:41:10,570
And then athletes on average are higher than the non-athletes.

501
00:41:11,652 --> 00:41:13,555
And so you can kind of see this trend go through.

502
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,322
OK, I don't know if anyone knows this.

503
00:41:19,322 --> 00:41:22,887
We don't have to break out into a group thought question here.

504
00:41:22,887 --> 00:41:30,218
But does anyone have an idea of what the highest recorded VO2 max is for male and female, around?

505
00:41:30,218 --> 00:41:38,190
So we showed from 30 to about 71 was the averages, or the range from 30 to 71.

506
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,433
Does anyone have an idea?

507
00:41:43,218 --> 00:41:44,299
That's OK if you don't.

508
00:41:44,299 --> 00:41:44,940
I'm just curious.

509
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,167
Sometimes people are like, oh, I know.

510
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:50,532
I know this individual because it was very polarized.

511
00:41:52,334 --> 00:41:53,936
OK, so the highest value.

512
00:41:53,936 --> 00:41:56,439
So if we go back here, remember, so at 38 here, 44,

513
00:41:56,439 --> 00:42:06,593
55, and 71, this kind of 10 milliliters per kilogram per minute stepwise increase is quite normal.

514
00:42:07,501 --> 00:42:17,178
Oscar was a professional cyclist who had a VO2 max recorded of 96.7, and then Joanne had 78.6.

515
00:42:17,178 --> 00:42:22,789
So that was quite surprising to see, and this was on a consistent basis.

516
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:25,273
So this was...

517
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,564
Oscar has a very interesting story, and there are a

518
00:42:29,564 --> 00:42:34,995
lot of things kind of circulating about his kind of potential to be successful.

519
00:42:34,995 --> 00:42:38,082
And so you would imagine that this individual, this is

520
00:42:38,082 --> 00:42:43,633
kind of old, very old now data-wise, that you would imagine that this individual would be

521
00:42:44,677 --> 00:42:49,067
kind of everywhere, and you'd hear about him being a very successful cyclist.

522
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,993
And that did not turn out to be the case.

523
00:42:51,993 --> 00:42:55,761
And that's not necessarily to say that he wasn't very successful.

524
00:42:55,761 --> 00:42:58,387
It's just there were other things kind of surrounding the area.

525
00:42:58,387 --> 00:43:03,799
But a VO2 max is not the only thing that makes someone a good athlete.

526
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:08,796
But this case study that was published in 2019, obviously

527
00:43:08,796 --> 00:43:14,085
the data were collected much earlier, so 2011, 2012, 2012, and 2013.

528
00:43:15,167 --> 00:43:17,772
But this was the case study for Oscar here.

529
00:43:17,772 --> 00:43:25,345
And he had a VO2 max across these two years, 85, 96.7, 92.8, and 86.5.

530
00:43:25,345 --> 00:43:29,293
The nice thing about saying this is, number one, once

531
00:43:29,293 --> 00:43:34,764
you have, like, if you record one really high VO2 max, it's not like you're just set there forever, right?

532
00:43:34,764 --> 00:43:36,127
Things fluctuate.

533
00:43:36,127 --> 00:43:41,157
One of the biggest things that do fluctuate would be body mass changes.

534
00:43:41,157 --> 00:43:45,581
a decent amount of body mass changes, and that doesn't necessarily mean that's bad.

535
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:51,087
If he had a two kilogram increase in body mass, and it was all lean muscle mass,

536
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,609
I would say that was probably a really good increase

537
00:43:53,609 --> 00:43:57,012
in body mass, even though the relative VOT max went down.

538
00:43:58,574 --> 00:44:00,396
Here's the other thing that was pretty impressive.

539
00:44:02,978 --> 00:44:08,444
What was on average the five second peak power for Wingate?

540
00:44:08,444 --> 00:44:10,132
Does anyone remember?

541
00:44:10,132 --> 00:44:13,636
Like what was like a pretty average or decent power output

542
00:44:13,636 --> 00:44:20,503
that was being put out for your five second windgate max?

543
00:44:20,503 --> 00:44:22,605
Like I saw a few at 700 maybe.

544
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:28,972
Yeah, like 600, 500, right?

545
00:44:28,972 --> 00:44:31,415
I think that's most people were around that range.

546
00:44:31,415 --> 00:44:34,058
And yeah, they were a little lower and a little bit above.

547
00:44:34,058 --> 00:44:38,752
But what's interesting about Oscar here is at all of these tests,

548
00:44:38,752 --> 00:44:39,813
500, 525, 537, 525.

549
00:44:41,155 --> 00:44:45,782
So he's just kind of cruising, not cruising, obviously it's a

550
00:44:45,782 --> 00:44:49,647
little bit hard, but at 500 watts at his VO2 max.

551
00:44:50,509 --> 00:44:52,912
And obviously, he had a higher VO2 max.

552
00:44:52,912 --> 00:45:00,062
So if you take 90% of that, he can easily press like 450 watts for two, four, six hours.

553
00:45:00,062 --> 00:45:01,464
So it's quite impressive.

554
00:45:01,464 --> 00:45:03,307
They don't have a high VO2 max.

555
00:45:03,307 --> 00:45:08,165
They don't have a very high, or sorry, a high power output, but they can hold

556
00:45:08,165 --> 00:45:10,753
a very high power output for long periods of time.

557
00:45:10,753 --> 00:45:12,317
So this is quite impressive.

558
00:45:15,808 --> 00:45:19,379
OK, so does that mean we can always do something to get up to that point?

559
00:45:19,379 --> 00:45:20,161
No.

560
00:45:20,161 --> 00:45:22,528
But if you wanted to increase your VO2 max,

561
00:45:23,588 --> 00:45:25,851
What might we want to do?

562
00:45:26,772 --> 00:45:32,359
Well, I would say that these three pieces would need to come into play.

563
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:37,826
So maybe chat with your neighbors for just a minute or two and talk about genetics aside.

564
00:45:37,826 --> 00:45:42,852
So if we can remove genetics, how much do you need to work out to improve your VO2 max?

565
00:45:42,852 --> 00:45:47,318
And try to think about the concepts of intensity, duration, and frequency.

566
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:51,503
And then we'll come back and see what you're feeling on these ones here.

567
00:47:26,995 --> 00:47:28,457
OK, what are we thinking?

568
00:47:30,461 --> 00:47:31,462
Let's start with intensity.

569
00:47:32,584 --> 00:47:34,067
Seems like the easiest one to go at.

570
00:47:38,073 --> 00:47:42,460
If someone came up to you and like, oh man, I heard you took exercise physiology

571
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,945
and I want to increase my VO2 max because I want

572
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:51,315
something near 90, what kind of training should I be doing as far as intensity?

573
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,664
Yeah, so I'd say modern intensity is pretty good.

574
00:48:03,664 --> 00:48:07,791
And they said, okay, well, why is modern intensity good for me?

575
00:48:07,791 --> 00:48:08,653
What would you say?

576
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:09,635
Or what would anyone say?

577
00:48:15,465 --> 00:48:17,348
Sorry, I don't mean to put you on the spot, but

578
00:48:17,348 --> 00:48:20,053
modern intensity, I could see where that's coming from because

579
00:48:21,704 --> 00:48:23,426
Yeah, you could do it for longer durations.

580
00:48:23,426 --> 00:48:27,632
And maybe you're going to get some of that activation of some of those pieces

581
00:48:27,632 --> 00:48:30,696
where you're going to get mitochondria biogenesis or

582
00:48:30,696 --> 00:48:34,221
increase in capillary density and then increase in protein synthesis.

583
00:48:34,221 --> 00:48:41,331
And I would totally agree that over time, those are all going to improve VO2 max.

584
00:48:41,331 --> 00:48:44,455
But if I'm thinking about the

585
00:48:45,413 --> 00:48:48,897
the overload principle, and you need to apply a certain

586
00:48:48,897 --> 00:48:53,143
amount of stress beyond what you're used to, and we're just trying to improve VO2 max.

587
00:48:54,004 --> 00:48:56,327
What type of intensity do you think we should be doing?

588
00:49:02,394 --> 00:49:07,160
Yeah, probably intensities at VO2 max, right?

589
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,923
Just at or just above VO2 max.

590
00:49:09,923 --> 00:49:11,185
What's the problem with that?

591
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:17,805
Yeah, if I tried to do that multiple times a

592
00:49:17,805 --> 00:49:21,910
day and tried to increase the duration, eventually something's going to go wrong, right?

593
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:28,399
Then you need to give yourself enough recovery to deal with that type of intensity.

594
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:31,604
And so you might not be having the same stimulus as

595
00:49:31,604 --> 00:49:35,629
you would want, or you're having these huge gaps where you do

596
00:49:35,629 --> 00:49:39,575
that exercise and then you have to wait four days before you can exercise again.

597
00:49:40,596 --> 00:49:41,998
So there is this kind of,

598
00:49:43,312 --> 00:49:46,481
problem where if I am doing these VO2 max workouts,

599
00:49:46,481 --> 00:49:50,351
which you should sprinkle in with moderate exercise intensity, the

600
00:49:50,351 --> 00:49:55,144
duration needs to come way down because we need to give ourselves a little bit of time to recover.

601
00:49:56,153 --> 00:49:57,855
Frequency, same thing.

602
00:49:57,855 --> 00:50:03,182
If I'm trying to improve VO2 max, yeah, I want to focus on maybe those higher intensity exercises.

603
00:50:04,184 --> 00:50:08,950
But now I have to do less of them per week compared to some of the easier exercises.

604
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:11,413
So if I'm doing a VO2 max workout or a workout

605
00:50:11,413 --> 00:50:15,278
at VO2 max power, then the subsequent exercises might need to

606
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:19,864
be relatively low to give myself a little bit of time to recover before I start that again.

607
00:50:21,547 --> 00:50:21,807
Good.

608
00:50:24,368 --> 00:50:28,899
And so there's always a balance between high intensity to exercise and moderate

609
00:50:28,899 --> 00:50:32,507
where we want to stay at or above lactate threshold right

610
00:50:32,507 --> 00:50:40,707
in that area to get some of the adaptations that we see with PCG1 alpha, right?

611
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:47,289
OK, so changes in VO2 max over 12 months.

612
00:50:47,289 --> 00:50:50,735
We definitely can get that increase in VO2 max.

613
00:50:50,735 --> 00:50:54,803
Keep in mind, though, that the initial starting level does

614
00:50:54,803 --> 00:50:59,050
determine how far or how much someone can change.

615
00:51:02,894 --> 00:51:06,380
And as we just talked about, exercise intensities closer to

616
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,746
100% is going to show the greatest improvement.

617
00:51:09,746 --> 00:51:14,254
So at very close to 100%, we're going to see the most improvement.

618
00:51:14,254 --> 00:51:17,920
But as soon as you start going a little bit above

619
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,548
that for longer periods of time, well, we need to be really careful about overtraining.

620
00:51:22,548 --> 00:51:27,737
So this balance of staying up here is very difficult, but it can be done.

621
00:51:30,805 --> 00:51:33,768
So intensity, not duration.

622
00:51:33,768 --> 00:51:37,112
And that's just because you can't maintain this high intensity

623
00:51:37,112 --> 00:51:50,186
for long periods of time is more important for improving the O2 max.

624
00:51:50,186 --> 00:51:53,590
So kind of going right back onto that, if you want some kind of

625
00:51:54,717 --> 00:52:00,005
overall arching figure on intensity, duration, and frequency, this would be a really good figure.

626
00:52:00,005 --> 00:52:02,469
If we're saying percent improvement in VO2 max on

627
00:52:02,469 --> 00:52:07,056
this y-axis, and then we have frequency, intensity, and duration down

628
00:52:07,056 --> 00:52:14,461
here, we can see that if you are getting some gains here,

629
00:52:14,461 --> 00:52:20,610
typically we can get them at certain intensities and frequencies and durations.

630
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:23,695
And yes, we will get the most optimal or the

631
00:52:23,695 --> 00:52:27,621
highest improvements at the highest intensity with the highest

632
00:52:27,621 --> 00:52:33,210
frequency and the most duration, but now you are exponentially

633
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:37,937
increasing the risk for injury as well as other complications.

634
00:52:39,976 --> 00:52:42,280
So there's a little bit of a trade off where we

635
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,426
probably don't want to have the most optimal improvements in

636
00:52:46,426 --> 00:52:50,512
VO2Max because we don't want these types of risks.

637
00:52:50,512 --> 00:52:55,500
And we need to stay kind of in this, I guess, middle zone over here.

638
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:03,773
OK.

639
00:53:06,402 --> 00:53:10,888
One thing we have trouble doing is most of us, if not

640
00:53:10,888 --> 00:53:20,962
all of us, cannot get on a treadmill and then say like, okay, I'm gonna be at 50% VO2 max, right?

641
00:53:20,962 --> 00:53:25,469
We just don't have the ability to always consistently know

642
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:28,677
where we're at with VO2 or oxygen consumption.

643
00:53:28,677 --> 00:53:31,924
So what's another way that most of us may use or most

644
00:53:31,924 --> 00:53:37,597
individuals may use to try to get an idea of how hard we are working, like how hard your body's working?

645
00:53:38,739 --> 00:53:40,062
Yeah, someone say that again?

646
00:53:40,062 --> 00:53:40,844
Heart rate, right?

647
00:53:40,844 --> 00:53:42,327
So heart rate's a really good one.

648
00:53:42,327 --> 00:53:47,378
So we usually use measurements of heart rate to get an idea of exercise intensity.

649
00:53:49,349 --> 00:53:52,714
This table down here is not something you would ever need to memorize.

650
00:53:52,714 --> 00:53:55,637
But if you ever wanted to look, this is very

651
00:53:55,637 --> 00:54:00,164
common where people break things out in intensity zones.

652
00:54:00,164 --> 00:54:03,148
So zone one, zone two, zone three, zone four, zone five.

653
00:54:03,148 --> 00:54:07,433
And then they break these things down into percentage of your heart rate max.

654
00:54:07,433 --> 00:54:11,679
And just like you did in class, they use VO2 reserve,

655
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:15,184
move those over to heart rate reserve, and then get them to heart rate values.

656
00:54:15,184 --> 00:54:19,069
So then we can get a good idea of how hard an individual should be exercising.

657
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:30,434
Yeah, so it depends.

658
00:54:31,235 --> 00:54:42,961
The more data you give the Garmin program, the closer it starts to approach on a good number.

659
00:54:42,961 --> 00:54:47,047
Not that I want to bring stats in here, but the central limit theorem does prove that.

660
00:54:47,047 --> 00:54:50,212
The higher the number of samples, eventually you're going to

661
00:54:50,212 --> 00:54:53,758
get that curve to come very close to what your true VO2 max is.

662
00:54:53,758 --> 00:54:56,642
But the problem is now you need to give it enough

663
00:54:56,642 --> 00:55:02,732
data that's spread out, so low intensity and really high intensity, and a lot of those data points.

664
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:05,236
But as someone is doing that,

665
00:55:05,236 --> 00:55:08,802
Now your VO2 max might be changing at the same time.

666
00:55:08,802 --> 00:55:11,827
So I would say it depends on when you're capturing it.

667
00:55:11,827 --> 00:55:15,413
It could be really close or it could be way off.

668
00:55:15,413 --> 00:55:19,920
But the technology has gotten a lot better though.

669
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,523
And on that same concept,

670
00:55:25,537 --> 00:55:30,706
you might be asking, well, which is more accurate at estimating heart rate?

671
00:55:30,706 --> 00:55:33,571
Because you probably all have seen in lab maybe some

672
00:55:33,571 --> 00:55:41,124
difficulties getting the chest strap to maybe get a good reading or fit very well.

673
00:55:41,124 --> 00:55:46,112
And so more commonly, most individuals have some type of

674
00:55:46,112 --> 00:55:50,700
watch that reads heart rate or gets some estimation of intensity.

675
00:55:52,064 --> 00:55:54,187
We don't have to go through this question because you

676
00:55:54,187 --> 00:55:58,094
probably all are going to say the watch because you probably hate the chest strap from Lab,

677
00:55:58,094 --> 00:56:01,820
but in general, the chest straps are always going to be

678
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:06,087
a little bit more, not a little bit more, but significantly more accurate.

679
00:56:06,087 --> 00:56:09,091
Here's the problem, though, with heart rate straps or heart

680
00:56:09,091 --> 00:56:13,178
rate watches and VO2 or any other metric that you're getting from the watch.

681
00:56:14,052 --> 00:56:19,745
On average, the accuracy of the heart rate is actually pretty good.

682
00:56:20,927 --> 00:56:23,994
So the way to read this study would be, so they did

683
00:56:23,994 --> 00:56:27,462
a polar strap, the ones that you guys use in class, and they

684
00:56:27,462 --> 00:56:33,495
also did an EKG here to get the actual heart rate from EKG measurements.

685
00:56:34,454 --> 00:56:37,319
And it looks like the average is right on there.

686
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:41,445
So this difference of zero meaning is the watch gets, or

687
00:56:41,445 --> 00:56:44,751
the heart rate strap gets 100, and the EKG is getting 100.

688
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:48,777
As you start to spread out here, that just means some

689
00:56:48,777 --> 00:56:51,822
of these values are not as accurate from the EKG.

690
00:56:52,884 --> 00:56:56,550
And so the polar strap is going to be the most accurate, or the chest strap.

691
00:56:57,391 --> 00:57:00,917
And if you look at the averages for everything, though,

692
00:57:02,416 --> 00:57:03,837
They're all on this zero.

693
00:57:04,758 --> 00:57:12,145
So if you took the averages for every single one, the overall arching conclusion might be

694
00:57:12,145 --> 00:57:17,430
that using one of these Fitbits or a Garmin watch or

695
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:22,114
an Apple watch would be the same because the averages are all the same.

696
00:57:23,995 --> 00:57:26,278
Anyone who's taken, no, you all have taken stats, but

697
00:57:26,278 --> 00:57:28,199
if you remember from stats, what's the problem then?

698
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,242
Just looking at this data or these data.

699
00:57:35,288 --> 00:57:38,379
And you probably experienced this once or twice, if you ever

700
00:57:38,379 --> 00:57:40,788
looked down at your watch and got a heart rate.

701
00:57:40,788 --> 00:57:46,328
But looking at these data, what's the concerning piece to how this is displayed?

702
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:50,570
Yeah, not necessarily outliers, but the spread.

703
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:52,713
The spread is really, really wide.

704
00:57:52,713 --> 00:57:56,899
So at any point in time, for this particular watch here,

705
00:57:56,899 --> 00:57:59,983
you could have a ton of these data points that are 20%

706
00:57:59,983 --> 00:58:03,728
different, 20% lower than what your actual heart rate is.

707
00:58:03,728 --> 00:58:06,953
And the more spread you have, the more chances you look

708
00:58:06,953 --> 00:58:10,135
down at your watch, and it's going to be way off.

709
00:58:10,135 --> 00:58:14,302
But if you were to average all the values or record every single value

710
00:58:14,302 --> 00:58:17,127
and then average them, yeah, I would agree you have just

711
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:19,671
as many below and above the line, and you probably would

712
00:58:19,671 --> 00:58:24,399
get a decent measurement if you averaged your heart rate over five minutes.

713
00:58:25,641 --> 00:58:29,207
And so that's why we need to be careful with some of these heart rate

714
00:58:30,098 --> 00:58:35,004
measurements on a watch if we're just taking these like point values.

715
00:58:35,004 --> 00:58:38,147
And I would agree the chest strap also has that but at

716
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:42,132
least the range is a little bit lower or the variance is a little bit lower.

717
00:58:43,994 --> 00:58:45,856
So just something to kind of keep in mind when you're

718
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:48,799
using some of those straps or straps and watches.

719
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,724
Gold standard, obviously we want to do this EKG here.

720
00:58:53,685 --> 00:58:58,350
We cannot run with an EKG machine all the time on a treadmill so we have to use some type of

721
00:58:59,562 --> 00:59:02,706
heart rate monitor on the wrist or the chest.

722
00:59:03,928 --> 00:59:07,192
But typically, if you're getting that measurement from the chest strap, it's a lot better.

723
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:17,605
OK.

724
00:59:17,605 --> 00:59:17,846
All right.

725
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:20,349
I'm thinking this might be a good place to stop,

726
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:23,132
not necessarily to like, you're more than welcome to take off.

727
00:59:23,132 --> 00:59:28,233
But I also think, one, because you're checked out, but two,

728
00:59:28,233 --> 00:59:32,419
I'm happy to go over any last minute questions on chapter eight through 11.

729
00:59:33,641 --> 00:59:35,825
So if you want to, you can hang around and we can go through that.

730
00:59:35,825 --> 00:59:38,509
The one thing I will ask, though, is if you do hang around

731
00:59:38,509 --> 00:59:41,954
or if you do take off, just try not to be too disturbing

732
00:59:41,954 --> 00:59:44,839
as far as noise level, because it's hard for me to hear everybody.

733
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:49,626
But the exam on, oh, actually, really quick.

734
00:59:49,626 --> 00:59:54,814
I know you already have this, but the exam,

735
00:59:56,617 --> 00:59:58,059
It's 33 questions.

736
01:00:00,943 --> 01:00:07,010
Let me pull this up really quick.

737
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:08,753
33 questions, multiple choice.

738
01:00:08,753 --> 01:00:10,715
You have that one extra one here.

739
01:00:10,715 --> 01:00:14,280
And then these are some of the pieces that I've already shown you.

740
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,401
But just keep this in mind.

741
01:00:16,483 --> 01:00:18,986
Just don't forget your exams on Thursday.

742
01:00:18,986 --> 01:00:20,548
And yeah.

743
01:00:23,026 --> 01:00:25,229
The question that you got right will be question 33.

744
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,413
I put it at the very end.

745
01:00:30,698 --> 01:00:33,342
Any other questions, logistics or content related?

746
01:00:43,617 --> 01:00:48,084
And you don't have to stay around, so enjoy the day.

747
01:00:49,105 --> 01:00:50,147
If not, I'm here.
