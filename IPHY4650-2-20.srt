1
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:33,258
All right, welcome back everyone.

2
00:02:33,258 --> 00:02:40,926
Okay, today we're gonna get started or finish, or make

3
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:45,171
a pretty decent dent in the skeletal muscle chapter eight slides.

4
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:48,394
But before I do that, the moment you've probably been

5
00:02:48,394 --> 00:02:53,220
waiting for, I have received the grades for lab exam one.

6
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:56,243
I do often like to show

7
00:02:57,995 --> 00:03:01,238
So again, please, if you don't have questions now, you're more

8
00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:04,901
than welcome to email or set up a meeting with me or talk

9
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:09,225
about it anytime next week or this week if you have any questions.

10
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:10,346
All right.

11
00:03:11,647 --> 00:03:15,531
So let's, I'm gonna do a quick review because we kind of

12
00:03:15,531 --> 00:03:19,314
left off in the middle of this concept of muscle cramps.

13
00:03:19,314 --> 00:03:22,077
So we talked about muscle cramps being involuntary

14
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:27,982
muscle contractions that are often associated with prolonged high intensity exercise.

15
00:03:27,982 --> 00:03:36,160
We touched on this kind of this old classical theory of electrolyte depletion and dehydration.

16
00:03:37,062 --> 00:03:42,253
We then touched in as far as limitations to that theory.

17
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:46,462
We talked about how dehydration is systemic.

18
00:03:46,462 --> 00:03:47,945
It's everywhere.

19
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:53,570
But these localized cramps are not really experiencing that

20
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,713
large of a difference between the whole body.

21
00:03:56,713 --> 00:03:59,376
But we only have this localized cramp.

22
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:03,960
They've also done some studies looking at the difference

23
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,703
between individuals who are cramping and not cramping.

24
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:11,808
And if you get them to dehydrate, it's not inducing cramps in everyone.

25
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:16,112
So there's a little bit of an issue here going on where

26
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:25,047
If you were removing the equation of this

27
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:29,994
electrolyte depletion theory or dehydration, individuals still cramp.

28
00:04:29,994 --> 00:04:32,078
And I do want to clarify one thing.

29
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,566
Electrolytes and fluid intake is extremely important.

30
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:42,273
So I know I mentioned something about manufacturers always.

31
00:04:42,273 --> 00:04:45,438
Manufacturers are trying to increase profits.

32
00:04:45,438 --> 00:04:49,263
We do need electrolytes, and we do need fluid intake.

33
00:04:49,263 --> 00:04:53,769
A heat stroke is way more important, in my opinion, than a cramp.

34
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:57,974
I would rather avoid heat stroke or heat stress in that instance.

35
00:04:57,974 --> 00:05:04,582
But the difference is those two pieces have no impact on muscle cramps.

36
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:09,789
So it's not necessarily that you shouldn't be drinking electrolytes and fluid.

37
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:14,635
It's just we're trying to say that it has no bearing on muscle cramps.

38
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,706
And I think another great point was brought up about

39
00:05:18,706 --> 00:05:26,282
maybe like, OK, if I don't have enough calcium, calcium is really important in muscle contractions.

40
00:05:26,282 --> 00:05:28,267
OK, let's break that down really quick.

41
00:05:28,267 --> 00:05:31,153
Sarcoplasmic reticulum is releasing calcium.

42
00:05:31,153 --> 00:05:32,556
The calcium then goes where?

43
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:37,929
binds to, I think someone said it, troponin moves tropomycin,

44
00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:40,193
reveals the site, and then you get the cross-bridge.

45
00:05:40,193 --> 00:05:42,777
Once you get the cross-bridge, you get a muscle contraction.

46
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:47,044
If I reduce the concentration of calcium because I

47
00:05:47,044 --> 00:05:50,069
have an electrolyte depletion theory, what happens?

48
00:05:53,013 --> 00:05:57,641
If I remove calcium, no contraction.

49
00:05:58,803 --> 00:06:00,906
That's the opposite of a cramp.

50
00:06:01,814 --> 00:06:03,898
You could do that for any of the electrolytes

51
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:10,230
involved in the excitation-contraction coupling, as well as the cross-bridge formation.

52
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:16,162
Anywhere on there that you remove the electrolytes, it would do the opposite effect.

53
00:06:16,162 --> 00:06:17,605
Obviously, we'd be dead.

54
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:25,237
But you wouldn't have an electrical signal to cause it to contract.

55
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:29,522
So those are the things that we need to think about, like mechanistically.

56
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,445
There's nowhere in that process that really has

57
00:06:32,445 --> 00:06:36,290
a bearing with this dehydration electrolyte theory.

58
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:40,314
We then touched on, OK, well, we obviously get cramps.

59
00:06:40,314 --> 00:06:46,261
We like to do research, and we want to try to kind of piece out maybe potential mechanisms.

60
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:48,184
This is not the only mechanism.

61
00:06:49,185 --> 00:06:52,088
One other piece that I like to talk about,

62
00:06:53,553 --> 00:06:59,101
If you don't, or what is ATP's role in the cross-bridge cycle?

63
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:05,930
So if we don't have ATP, what problem do we run into?

64
00:07:10,316 --> 00:07:12,800
Yeah, the myosin head won't release.

65
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,405
If the myosin head doesn't release, and if I make a

66
00:07:16,405 --> 00:07:21,143
strong contraction right now and then all of a sudden I deplete all the ATP, could I open my hand up?

67
00:07:21,143 --> 00:07:21,947
No.

68
00:07:21,947 --> 00:07:27,370
And that's kind of the fundamental basis behind rigor mortis.

69
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,797
There are other potential areas that could cause some issues.

70
00:07:31,797 --> 00:07:35,242
Maybe acetylcholine esterase is a really important piece in muscle cramps.

71
00:07:35,242 --> 00:07:37,766
I'm not saying this is the only thing, but this

72
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:43,374
is the only piece where we've actually established some evidence to support contribution in cramps.

73
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:47,560
So we have an increased excitatory activity of the

74
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,847
muscle spindles, a reduced inhibitory effect of the Golgi tendon organs.

75
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:56,213
If we do that, then that's causing

76
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,642
the kind of, I guess the cards to a line

77
00:08:00,642 --> 00:08:04,147
where you're increasing the chances of experiencing a muscle cramp.

78
00:08:04,147 --> 00:08:08,254
Since the muscle spindle is really trying to get the

79
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:12,841
muscle to contract and if I increase the activity of that, then I can induce a cramp.

80
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:16,147
If the Golgi tendon organ is detecting some type of tension

81
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:22,116
and I remove the ability for the Golgi tendon to inhibit those signals to contract,

82
00:08:23,142 --> 00:08:25,630
then the muscle spindle is kind of having free reign

83
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,818
to get it to contract and you might experience a cramp.

84
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:33,557
We briefly talked about how stretching appears to relieve the muscle cramp.

85
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:39,720
This activates the Golgi tendon organ to try to inhibit the motor neurons.

86
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,187
You are applying some type of tension, and then you're

87
00:08:44,187 --> 00:08:47,573
sending that signal to the Golgi tendon organ to inhibit, inhibit,

88
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:53,402
and inhibit, and a lot of the times that signal is strong enough to get the muscles to try and relax.

89
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:59,879
In addition, some massaging has been speculated to potentially

90
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:05,306
try to help, not reset, but maybe help change the activation of

91
00:09:05,306 --> 00:09:07,328
the muscle spindles to try to get it to relax.

92
00:09:11,254 --> 00:09:15,719
They've also done studies where they've kind of cut the

93
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:20,185
signal from the muscle spindles, and that inherently reduces cramps.

94
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:24,280
There's another thing.

95
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:31,789
that you may have heard of that can send some signals to those same areas.

96
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:38,097
So ginger and capsaicin is in red peppers and

97
00:09:38,097 --> 00:09:44,906
they can activate these transient receptor potential kind of channels.

98
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:48,330
So these TRP channels here.

99
00:09:50,183 --> 00:09:54,655
And they then send an inhibitory signal to the spinal

100
00:09:54,655 --> 00:10:01,594
cord that then helps maybe reduce the overactive motor neurons that are causing cramping.

101
00:10:04,088 --> 00:10:07,673
So of course, they didn't start with ginger and capsaicin.

102
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:11,879
They started by activating these TRP receptors.

103
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,944
They did it in mice models, and then they tried to move on to human models.

104
00:10:15,944 --> 00:10:18,808
And when they activated these, they realized they

105
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:22,553
were reducing cramps or reducing the contractions.

106
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:26,998
So of course, right, clever individuals, they were thinking,

107
00:10:26,998 --> 00:10:30,746
okay, well, what in food triggers these receptors?

108
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:33,632
And it happens to be ginger and capsaicin.

109
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:38,803
We find capsaicin in like red peppers, so spicy food.

110
00:10:40,842 --> 00:10:44,306
So temperature and spicy sensation has been known to

111
00:10:44,306 --> 00:10:50,152
try to, well, activate these channels and reduce the sensation

112
00:10:50,152 --> 00:10:55,558
or the signal or the overactive signal that's being sent to the muscles.

113
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,884
Yeah.

114
00:11:00,884 --> 00:11:05,609
Yeah, a little bit, but the magnitude of stimulation from

115
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:08,672
that isn't good, isn't great enough to trigger this.

116
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:18,969
If I knew this, as young entrepreneurs, what do you think you're gonna go out and try to do?

117
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:25,759
Yeah, make a muscle cramp juice with spicy stuff.

118
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:28,784
Well, has anyone heard of hotshot?

119
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,948
So this is the idea behind hotshot.

120
00:11:33,471 --> 00:11:38,167
Now, they've run some trials on it and they don't eliminate cramps.

121
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:43,634
But they've suggested, their data kind of suggests that it might reduce some of the cramps.

122
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:49,502
So I'm not saying that, I have no affiliation here, but I'm not saying you should go out

123
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:53,528
and drink those, but to be honest, that's probably

124
00:11:53,528 --> 00:11:57,473
the closest thing that might trigger these receptors for some individuals.

125
00:11:57,473 --> 00:12:03,061
They've noted that it doesn't work for everybody, but that's the kind of idea behind this.

126
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,524
It's pretty neat though.

127
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:13,231
Okay, fiber types is the next topic here.

128
00:12:15,716 --> 00:12:18,060
There's a little table here that you can go through and

129
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:25,574
fill out, very similar to the previous, I guess, energy pathway

130
00:12:25,574 --> 00:12:28,299
table that we looked at at chapters three and four.

131
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:30,263
I would say this is a great place, oh yeah, sorry, go ahead.

132
00:12:44,553 --> 00:12:46,817
Well, yeah, and that's what I'm saying.

133
00:12:46,817 --> 00:12:49,682
It could be speculated that if you didn't have enough

134
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:55,773
ATP to release the myosin head, it would stay in that contracted kind of state.

135
00:12:58,718 --> 00:13:01,042
Well, so there's no evidence to support that.

136
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:04,388
I'm just saying you could imagine, besides this altered

137
00:13:04,388 --> 00:13:10,118
neuromuscular theory, there could be other areas that are influencing

138
00:13:10,118 --> 00:13:12,507
an individual's ability to cramp.

139
00:13:12,507 --> 00:13:19,231
Because if it only was this, then theoretically, I could eliminate cramps

140
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,097
by maybe triggering these TRP receptors.

141
00:13:23,097 --> 00:13:24,459
And you don't eliminate cramps.

142
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:30,189
People still getting cramps, but it seems to reduce the impact or reduce the length or magnitude.

143
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:32,132
But it doesn't eliminate them.

144
00:13:32,132 --> 00:13:37,020
So this is the best theory to date that we have the most evidence on.

145
00:13:37,821 --> 00:13:40,786
Right now, we don't have any other evidence to support other theories.

146
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:44,411
Yeah.

147
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:45,093
That's a great question.

148
00:13:45,093 --> 00:13:45,373
Thank you.

149
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:50,112
Oh, man, I feel like it's, sorry.

150
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:51,294
I know it gets loud in the back.

151
00:13:51,294 --> 00:13:53,879
I don't know what's going on with the mic, but okay.

152
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,342
So yeah, go ahead and fill this out.

153
00:13:56,424 --> 00:13:57,786
It'll be a good resource.

154
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:00,030
Obviously, there's not enough room to put a lot of

155
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:04,999
stuff, but if something's saying slow, fast, faster, then that's pretty easy to put into here.

156
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:11,238
OK, so how are skeletal muscle fibers typed?

157
00:14:11,238 --> 00:14:15,124
Well, they're typed by you first have to do a muscle biopsy.

158
00:14:15,124 --> 00:14:18,329
You take a small piece of muscle, you remove that, you put

159
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:24,559
it in a Petri dish, and you start going through some techniques to determine muscle fiber type.

160
00:14:26,922 --> 00:14:28,645
It's pretty complex.

161
00:14:28,645 --> 00:14:31,790
If you look at this chart here, there are a lot

162
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:36,805
of different names that have been used in a variety of different papers.

163
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:42,490
One of the biggest, I guess, changes that have been made

164
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,612
that we need to be a little bit careful about when

165
00:14:44,612 --> 00:14:54,761
we're reading literature that's relatively recent is this idea that we went from type 2b to d and x here.

166
00:14:56,583 --> 00:15:04,396
We'll talk about type 2b in a second, but a true type 2b

167
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:09,526
muscle fiber is not really expressed the way we believe it is in humans.

168
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:14,176
So they switched this notation from type 2B to type 2X.

169
00:15:14,176 --> 00:15:19,972
Sometimes it's seen as D. So I would say this top row

170
00:15:19,972 --> 00:15:22,274
was determined immunohistochemically.

171
00:15:23,095 --> 00:15:30,021
And this is the fiber typing that we kind of go off of today, would be this top row.

172
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:36,286
But you've probably heard of a lot of these here, slow Twitch, fast Twitch, colors as well.

173
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:38,788
Some people had said red, intermediate, and white.

174
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:45,834
Those are also used in the literature or even in maybe common terms.

175
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:49,958
But just know that those were based off of older typing methods.

176
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:56,694
And now this newer one using kind of antibodies is the best method right now.

177
00:15:56,694 --> 00:16:04,373
So this top row is the row we're going to be using as far as categorizing different fiber types.

178
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:13,656
What does it look like when we stain adult skeletal muscle or just skeletal muscle in general?

179
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:16,820
If I'm looking at type 1 fibers, they kind of light up here.

180
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,544
So on the left, this would be mouse models.

181
00:16:19,544 --> 00:16:22,247
And then this would be human muscle over here.

182
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:29,136
And so we're seeing that, indeed, both mice and humans have these type 1 fibers.

183
00:16:29,136 --> 00:16:33,682
And then type 2a, those are also lighting up here.

184
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:37,228
and in the mouse model, and same with type 2X.

185
00:16:37,228 --> 00:16:45,563
Type 2B, we don't see any proteins being formed that are of the type 2B,

186
00:16:45,563 --> 00:16:52,174
but the mouse models, cats, other animals do express and

187
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:57,343
fold proteins that kind of create these type 2B fibers.

188
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:04,647
Type 2b fibers, they generate the most amount of power.

189
00:17:04,647 --> 00:17:12,378
So I guess they can generate more force compared to a type 2x fiber.

190
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:17,806
So in this instance, we're going from kind of on a force spectrum lowest to highest here.

191
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:26,419
So today, we basically say humans

192
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:34,671
We actually have the gene, we contain the gene for type 2B fibers.

193
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:40,559
It's always believed though that we just don't express those fibers, right?

194
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:47,489
Like we don't actually translate them into RNA and we go through and then fold these proteins.

195
00:17:47,489 --> 00:17:52,035
But we do have that gene inside of our DNA.

196
00:17:54,698 --> 00:18:01,450
And interestingly enough, in some rare conditions, we actually

197
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:09,805
get some of these fibers to start or we get these proteins to express or these genes to express.

198
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:14,293
So this is myosin heavy chain type 2b mRNA expression.

199
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:18,863
These are control individuals.

200
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:23,594
And over here, we basically have muscular dystrophy on all of these.

201
00:18:23,594 --> 00:18:28,405
But this is a very unique version of the muscular dystrophy.

202
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:31,112
It's the Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

203
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:37,547
And they actually express this protein or this gene.

204
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:44,686
What's odd though is that even though they're expressing

205
00:18:44,686 --> 00:18:48,492
it, they don't really produce the protein itself.

206
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:54,362
So even when they stain for it, some of them, it seems like there might be something going on.

207
00:18:56,245 --> 00:19:01,293
And a more recent study in 2020, individuals went

208
00:19:01,293 --> 00:19:08,985
through some high intensity exercise and they saw over here that in normal individuals,

209
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:18,363
that they're getting a little bit of expression of this type 2b myosin heavy chain pre-mRNA.

210
00:19:19,665 --> 00:19:22,369
But in these individuals, we can get it to express

211
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:27,337
it just never really gets into the protein folding stage.

212
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:33,647
Because I get the very common question before this 2020

213
00:19:33,647 --> 00:19:38,429
study, it was always like, well, if we have the gene,

214
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:40,392
All we have to do is really activate it, right?

215
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:44,998
There is ongoing research right now that they're trying to

216
00:19:44,998 --> 00:19:49,644
see if we can get these proteins to activate, express, and then fold.

217
00:19:49,644 --> 00:19:53,689
Or this gene, sorry, to activate and then express and then fold.

218
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:58,175
So it's kind of a scary but exciting area to kind of be looking at.

219
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:05,044
However, for now, we're kind of stuck on this type 1, type 2a, and type 2x.

220
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:10,336
Type 2-1 fibers, slow twitch, slow oxidative fibers.

221
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:13,640
Type 2A are these immediate fibers.

222
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,583
They're fast, oxidative glycolytic fibers.

223
00:20:18,045 --> 00:20:21,789
And type 2B are the fast twitch fibers or the fast glycolytic fibers.

224
00:20:24,531 --> 00:20:30,778
If we could stain a muscle, you would see the different fiber types throughout.

225
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:37,797
Okay, so we have these different fiber types.

226
00:20:38,778 --> 00:20:43,726
We need to develop some characteristics to kind of distinguish the two.

227
00:20:43,726 --> 00:20:47,252
And we're gonna start with biochemical properties.

228
00:20:48,574 --> 00:20:52,881
For the biochemical properties, it would be the oxidative capacity.

229
00:20:53,822 --> 00:20:56,467
In this instance, we're looking at the number of

230
00:20:56,467 --> 00:21:02,365
capillaries that surround these kind of fibers that we're looking at.

231
00:21:02,365 --> 00:21:08,031
also the mitochondrial density inside of these fibers, and the amount of myoglobin.

232
00:21:10,074 --> 00:21:15,439
So you can imagine the more blood flow because of capillaries is gonna help deliver the oxygen,

233
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:20,205
well, you also probably need more mitochondria to help

234
00:21:20,205 --> 00:21:25,501
utilize that oxygen to undergo oxidative phosphorylation.

235
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:32,554
Myoglobin is extremely important in kind of moving oxygen from the hemoglobin into the muscles.

236
00:21:36,441 --> 00:21:41,109
So here, this is, it's relatively easy as far as, you

237
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:43,714
just need to look on one end versus the other because they're

238
00:21:43,714 --> 00:21:47,962
kind of opposite, and then the type 2a is always in between.

239
00:21:47,962 --> 00:21:51,786
Number of mitochondria low versus high, low versus high.

240
00:21:51,786 --> 00:22:00,735
Non-oxidative or anaerobic versus aerobic, or oxidative.

241
00:22:00,735 --> 00:22:03,357
OK, we'll move on to biochemical property number two.

242
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:08,102
This would be the type of myosin ATPase isoform.

243
00:22:09,784 --> 00:22:10,204
That's a lot.

244
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,206
What's an ATPase, first of all?

245
00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:15,910
Myosin ATPase.

246
00:22:17,729 --> 00:22:20,292
It's kind of in the name, but where do we find this and what does it do?

247
00:22:25,938 --> 00:22:27,400
Yeah, it breaks down ATP and where?

248
00:22:29,663 --> 00:22:30,584
In the name.

249
00:22:30,584 --> 00:22:32,206
In the myosin heads, right?

250
00:22:32,206 --> 00:22:35,970
So this helps kind of break down the ATP, it hydrolyzes

251
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,693
it and we kind of release some of that free energy and get

252
00:22:38,693 --> 00:22:43,078
it ready or the myosin gets ready to be in that kind of high energy state.

253
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:50,296
When we're looking at different isoforms, there are different types of the ATPase.

254
00:22:51,358 --> 00:22:57,849
Those different types of myosin ATPase help break down or

255
00:22:57,849 --> 00:23:01,915
kind of hydrolyze those ATPs faster or slower.

256
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,717
You have the fastest

257
00:23:06,717 --> 00:23:13,985
or highest or the most ATP degradation or energy releasing

258
00:23:13,985 --> 00:23:18,190
isoforms in the type 2X and then the lowest in the type 1.

259
00:23:22,214 --> 00:23:27,060
The third biochemical property would be the abundance of contractile proteins.

260
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:33,467
Those contractile proteins are the sarcomeres, which are actin and myosin in the muscle fiber.

261
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:40,812
So you just have more actin and myosin in different fibers.

262
00:23:42,394 --> 00:23:45,058
More in the type 2X, less in the type 1.

263
00:23:50,825 --> 00:23:53,528
OK, now that we've moved or we talked about

264
00:23:53,528 --> 00:23:58,454
the biochemical properties, let's talk about the contractile properties.

265
00:24:00,176 --> 00:24:03,420
So the first one would be the speed of contraction.

266
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:09,564
This is dependent on that myosin ATPase activity.

267
00:24:10,686 --> 00:24:13,810
The faster that I can break down those ATPs and cycle

268
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,234
through them, then the faster I can get another one to go

269
00:24:16,234 --> 00:24:19,358
on, release the myosin head, and then it can contract again.

270
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:23,063
The faster you can undergo that cross-bridge cycling.

271
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,172
If we're looking at the speed of contraction,

272
00:24:31,008 --> 00:24:34,654
We're saying type one is the lowest, type two X

273
00:24:34,654 --> 00:24:37,558
is the fastest as far as maximal shortening velocity.

274
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:44,309
What is the mechanism behind some of that speed besides the ATPase activity?

275
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:47,333
Well, in addition to that, we have the sarcoplasmic

276
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:53,202
reticulum release, releasing ability or the rate of release is faster.

277
00:24:54,624 --> 00:24:56,948
We've already touched on the ATPase activity.

278
00:24:58,902 --> 00:25:01,947
But the faster we can get the calcium to kind of

279
00:25:01,947 --> 00:25:04,392
come out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and bind to that

280
00:25:04,392 --> 00:25:09,681
troponin, the faster you get that signal, the faster you can do the cross-bridge cycling.

281
00:25:15,651 --> 00:25:16,252
Are we OK here?

282
00:25:18,376 --> 00:25:19,197
All right, second one.

283
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,463
Maximal force production.

284
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:26,524
And when we're talking about maximal force production, we're

285
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:29,688
looking at the force per unit of cross-sectional area.

286
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:37,078
We don't really get into the biomechanics of certain things, like penny angle,

287
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:40,223
if we're talking about the anatomical or physiological

288
00:25:40,223 --> 00:25:42,906
cross-sectional area versus just the cross-sectional area.

289
00:25:42,906 --> 00:25:44,482
We're not going to get into that.

290
00:25:44,482 --> 00:25:47,565
All we're going to talk about here is just you're

291
00:25:47,565 --> 00:25:55,173
able to produce more force per given cross-sectional area with the type 2x fibers versus the type 1.

292
00:25:59,998 --> 00:26:04,022
Here's another figure that's depicting the same thing here.

293
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:08,987
Maximal specific force, type 1, type 2a, type 2x.

294
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:18,342
The reason, or why do we want to look at cross-sectional area?

295
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:19,223
Why is that important?

296
00:26:20,526 --> 00:26:25,394
Maybe from a research perspective or from a conceptual piece.

297
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:30,182
Any ideas?

298
00:26:31,934 --> 00:26:35,259
Yeah, like what if I just took, in my analysis as

299
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:38,224
I'm doing these biopsies, I just took a bigger chunk of muscle

300
00:26:39,025 --> 00:26:43,833
and I compared the type 1 fiber to a smaller, a really small chunk of type 2x fiber.

301
00:26:44,634 --> 00:26:46,818
And then I put them on a force transducer and I'm

302
00:26:46,818 --> 00:26:49,622
like, oh look, type 1 fibers are generating more force.

303
00:26:50,564 --> 00:26:52,867
Well, that's not a fair comparison because you just have

304
00:26:52,867 --> 00:26:57,073
way more muscle in the type 1 fiber sample compared to the type 2.

305
00:26:57,894 --> 00:27:01,859
And so larger muscle fibers, they do produce more force than smaller muscle fibers

306
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,264
because they contain more actinomycin, but you have to

307
00:27:05,264 --> 00:27:08,588
make sure we're on the same cross-sectional area question.

308
00:27:11,412 --> 00:27:11,832
OK.

309
00:27:11,832 --> 00:27:15,357
With that in mind, what do we think here?

310
00:28:23,933 --> 00:28:25,695
Okay, I'll close this down here.

311
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:29,100
Double check you have something in.

312
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,242
I'll close it down in five seconds or so.

313
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:37,991
All right, three, two, one.

314
00:28:41,716 --> 00:28:43,659
Okay, like most things, right?

315
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,062
Are males stronger than females?

316
00:28:47,884 --> 00:28:50,127
Well, it depends, right?

317
00:28:51,322 --> 00:28:55,289
It's clear that if I got into an arm wrestling

318
00:28:55,289 --> 00:29:01,320
match or any type of resistance training, I'm almost positive I'm

319
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,908
going to be at a disadvantage compared to this athlete over here.

320
00:29:05,908 --> 00:29:09,575
I would even say that for this room or the varsity

321
00:29:09,575 --> 00:29:11,699
athletes that we have in this school, there are a lot

322
00:29:11,699 --> 00:29:16,465
of individuals who are stronger than me, female athletes.

323
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:20,251
And I know, we didn't have a leader board up the entire

324
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:25,339
time, but I know some of you ladies are throwing down some large watts on the wind gate.

325
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:27,422
I'm like, whoa, that's pretty impressive.

326
00:29:28,304 --> 00:29:31,709
But, so, my point is though, right, it depends.

327
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:33,031
It really depends.

328
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:37,118
So, if we're just talking about a broad perspective, like,

329
00:29:37,118 --> 00:29:43,688
oh, this person is stronger than that person, well, it does depend on the context of the question.

330
00:29:44,647 --> 00:29:48,053
And we're going to try to parse out some of these things here.

331
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:50,458
OK, so skeletal muscle mass in men and women.

332
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,728
On an average base, if we took all the males and

333
00:29:55,728 --> 00:30:01,218
compared them to the females, men have a significantly greater

334
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:04,123
total upper body and lower body skeletal mass.

335
00:30:05,116 --> 00:30:11,967
They just typically have on average more muscle compared to females.

336
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:18,537
That doesn't mean every female has less muscle than the male, right?

337
00:30:18,537 --> 00:30:22,804
But on average, they typically have a lower body mass.

338
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:28,950
If you have more muscle, you typically can generate a

339
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:34,315
higher absolute kind of force or weight movement.

340
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:39,960
So in terms of absolute force production, if we take examples from the Olympics,

341
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:46,226
the highest amount of weight for an Olympian, when we're

342
00:30:46,226 --> 00:30:51,291
looking at the snatch, that is being produced by male athletes.

343
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,188
But if I look here,

344
00:30:54,188 --> 00:31:01,845
There are women Olympians who are producing or have a higher snatch weight compared to the men.

345
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,813
And that's the same for other events.

346
00:31:07,096 --> 00:31:12,262
So we can see that at certain areas, if we're looking at weight class,

347
00:31:12,262 --> 00:31:21,214
that yeah, individuals who just have more muscle mass, an individual who's 105 kilograms,

348
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:24,699
I would expect them to be able to produce more force

349
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:30,868
than someone, even male or female, who is 50, 60 kilograms in body mass.

350
00:31:34,913 --> 00:31:37,457
Then we need to look at maybe fiber type distribution.

351
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,442
There appears that

352
00:31:42,502 --> 00:31:51,813
Between age and sex, there's no difference in fiber type distribution, meaning there's an equal,

353
00:31:51,813 --> 00:31:57,440
on average, an equal amount of individuals or people across

354
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,866
age ranges and sex that have the same amount of type one percentage fibers.

355
00:32:02,866 --> 00:32:05,929
Yes, there are some individuals who have more type one

356
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:10,635
compared to others, but between sexes and age, it's about the same.

357
00:32:16,117 --> 00:32:20,303
So then let's take an account for all of these things.

358
00:32:22,005 --> 00:32:27,172
If you express force production or strength, so this is

359
00:32:27,172 --> 00:32:30,136
arm flexor strength on the Y and cross sectional area.

360
00:32:30,136 --> 00:32:34,562
If you express it based on cross sectional area, there

361
00:32:34,562 --> 00:32:40,690
is no difference between men and women on force production.

362
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:47,977
So if I take the same cross-sectional area muscle from any individual

363
00:32:47,977 --> 00:32:50,680
and compare it to another individual of the same fiber

364
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,703
type, you're going to produce the same amount of force.

365
00:32:58,489 --> 00:33:01,552
This would be kind of the same figure that we're

366
00:33:01,552 --> 00:33:06,238
talking about, so knee extensor and elbow flexion.

367
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,824
If I am looking at force production on a cross-sectional area,

368
00:33:12,766 --> 00:33:16,934
I can eliminate any differences in strength.

369
00:33:22,924 --> 00:33:27,012
So regardless of sex or age, if an individual has a

370
00:33:27,012 --> 00:33:34,926
higher muscle mass, I would expect them to generate more force, independent, again, of sex and age.

371
00:33:38,095 --> 00:33:43,981
And we see that we've kind of provided that evidence by looking at these cross-sectional areas.

372
00:33:46,684 --> 00:33:51,569
It just so happens to be that younger individuals who

373
00:33:51,569 --> 00:33:55,593
are male have a higher muscle mass compared to others.

374
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:03,681
Okay, number three on the contractile property, higher power output.

375
00:34:08,318 --> 00:34:13,243
So this is talking about high force, fast fibers have high power output.

376
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:22,652
If we're looking at power, we're looking at force times the shortening velocity,

377
00:34:22,652 --> 00:34:27,837
the maximal power, like what we've been talking about before,

378
00:34:27,837 --> 00:34:32,361
but type one's lowest, type two A is in the middle, type two X is the highest.

379
00:34:33,963 --> 00:34:34,984
No surprise there.

380
00:34:38,845 --> 00:34:41,150
Number four, muscle fiber efficiency.

381
00:34:42,894 --> 00:34:47,443
Efficiency like we talked about, lower amount of ATP used to generate force.

382
00:34:48,365 --> 00:34:53,817
The efficiency is quite low with type 2X fibers and high with type 1 fibers.

383
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,183
So we just talked about this and we don't need to break

384
00:35:08,183 --> 00:35:12,228
off into a group or anything like that or class discussion.

385
00:35:12,228 --> 00:35:15,011
Maybe I'll just get some ideas right now.

386
00:35:15,011 --> 00:35:17,614
So now we know there's no apparent age or

387
00:35:17,614 --> 00:35:21,639
sex difference in fiber type distribution, yet everybody's muscles are different.

388
00:35:23,741 --> 00:35:26,244
The percentage of type one fibers that I have in my

389
00:35:26,244 --> 00:35:30,489
body is going to be different from someone in this class.

390
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:33,152
It might be the same, but more than likely it will be different.

391
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,043
So why is that?

392
00:35:36,043 --> 00:35:39,669
So what determines the distribution of respective fiber types in a muscle?

393
00:35:42,455 --> 00:35:45,560
Genetics is probably the biggest piece.

394
00:35:47,143 --> 00:35:48,266
Training, good.

395
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:50,129
That one we'll get into.

396
00:35:50,129 --> 00:35:55,407
Sometimes people think like cart before the horse or chicken before the egg, right?

397
00:35:55,407 --> 00:35:58,610
was I born with this fiber type distribution and then when

398
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:01,313
I was put in these sports and I just happened to excel

399
00:36:01,313 --> 00:36:05,998
in them and then continue there, or did the training push me through?

400
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:11,784
A lot of times it's a little bit of both, but there's this debate that we believe

401
00:36:11,784 --> 00:36:17,309
that it's more maybe you're just born with these fiber type distributions

402
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:19,752
and then you realize like, oh, I'm pretty good at

403
00:36:19,752 --> 00:36:24,516
sprinting, I'm gonna stick with this because I hate running long distance and then vice versa.

404
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:25,077
What else?

405
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,482
Kind of on the same topic, but.

406
00:36:35,094 --> 00:36:37,478
What would be the main difference, we've talked about

407
00:36:37,478 --> 00:36:45,250
maybe on average, I'm saying men typically have a higher muscle mass compared to women.

408
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:45,490
Why?

409
00:36:47,253 --> 00:36:48,094
What's different?

410
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,821
Hormones, right?

411
00:36:50,821 --> 00:36:54,725
So hormones play a large role and you can see after

412
00:36:54,725 --> 00:37:02,493
puberty, there's a big difference in the lean muscle mass compared to boys and girls, right?

413
00:37:02,493 --> 00:37:08,880
Okay, so genetics, exercise habits, blood level of hormones,

414
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:16,528
those are all playing roles in the amount of maybe fibers or fiber type distribution.

415
00:37:19,175 --> 00:37:24,385
But it is true that typically if we start sampling

416
00:37:24,385 --> 00:37:31,358
from all of the power athletes or sprinters, they typically have a higher percentage of fast twitch fibers.

417
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,807
The endurance athletes or the distance runners typically have

418
00:37:35,807 --> 00:37:38,652
a higher percentage of the slow fibers.

419
00:37:40,488 --> 00:37:48,054
Again, we don't really know if it is only training or only genetics.

420
00:37:48,054 --> 00:37:52,911
It's probably a little bit of both, but this is typically the distribution that we see.

421
00:37:55,034 --> 00:37:58,759
Please do not try to memorize this table, but it is

422
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:04,508
nice to look at if you're curious on fiber type distribution between different athletes.

423
00:38:05,509 --> 00:38:08,253
If you want to spend a lot of time on a

424
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:13,260
table with these distributions, you could just look at this one, right?

425
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,565
So in general, distance runners have a higher percentage

426
00:38:16,565 --> 00:38:23,455
of type one fibers compared to track athletes, and then non-athletes typically are right in that 50%

427
00:38:24,278 --> 00:38:25,179
like kind of area.

428
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:32,629
But there is a considerable amount of variation among successful athletes.

429
00:38:32,629 --> 00:38:38,597
You don't have to have 80% type one fibers to be a successful endurance athlete.

430
00:38:39,478 --> 00:38:45,887
We just typically find that spread in the highest amount for these types of athletes.

431
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:50,353
And in addition, oh yeah, go ahead.

432
00:38:53,101 --> 00:39:05,203
Exactly, yeah, yeah.

433
00:39:06,145 --> 00:39:12,192
There is no one parameter that is predicting performance, no matter what event it is.

434
00:39:12,192 --> 00:39:19,700
It's usually a wide, multifactorial combination of parameters

435
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:28,470
or indices that are determining whether someone has good or high success in a particular sport.

436
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:33,756
For a while, people thought Usain Bolt would never become a good sprinter because he was too tall.

437
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:40,694
But it turns out he's one of the greatest short distance sprinters that we've seen.

438
00:39:42,098 --> 00:39:44,644
But things happen, right?

439
00:39:44,644 --> 00:39:48,975
It doesn't necessarily mean you have to have a certain mold to be successful at a sport.

440
00:39:51,742 --> 00:39:53,210
OK.

441
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:55,133
So now that we've kind of gone through and I'm saying,

442
00:39:55,133 --> 00:40:00,102
okay, all these fiber types are kind of pushed in over here and that we have these type of distributions.

443
00:40:00,102 --> 00:40:05,252
I'd like to share really quick a study on these fiber types because it's quite interesting.

444
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:07,823
A lot of these are done

445
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:11,207
These muscle biopsies are not easy to do.

446
00:40:11,207 --> 00:40:17,334
And if I was an Olympic athlete, I would not want to take these muscle biopsies ever.

447
00:40:18,536 --> 00:40:23,682
You are removing a piece of force-generating tissue, and I don't really want to undergo that.

448
00:40:23,682 --> 00:40:26,565
So we have to be careful about some of this data.

449
00:40:26,565 --> 00:40:33,493
But there was a really great study done in 2015 where they took a

450
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:41,407
very recent retired world record holder for short distance Olympic event.

451
00:40:43,112 --> 00:40:47,024
So as soon as he kind of said he was retired,

452
00:40:47,024 --> 00:40:50,287
they asked him to be in the study, and he was like, sure.

453
00:40:50,287 --> 00:40:53,390
And they took a bunch of muscle biopsies.

454
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:56,753
No surprise here, if we're looking at type 1 versus type

455
00:40:56,753 --> 00:41:04,180
2 over here, these are both type 2, that 30% type 1 and then maybe closer to the 60%.

456
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:09,846
And then there are these hybrid fibers where you have type 1

457
00:41:09,846 --> 00:41:13,670
and type 2A and then type 2A and type 2X.

458
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:16,252
And so that's in there too, and that's what these are.

459
00:41:16,252 --> 00:41:20,958
Don't worry too much about that, and I'd never test you on these hybrid fibers.

460
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:23,841
This is more for kind of, it's fun to look at some of these things.

461
00:41:25,043 --> 00:41:30,750
Okay, so this sprinter has a larger percentage of type two fibers versus type one,

462
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:34,594
and so maybe that's why, or there's nothing really special

463
00:41:34,594 --> 00:41:39,340
going on, and maybe something else is going on that's helping with his performance.

464
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:44,783
If we look at maybe the single muscle fiber power

465
00:41:44,783 --> 00:41:49,016
that's being generated, this is kind of the trend that we're looking at, right?

466
00:41:49,016 --> 00:41:54,102
If we're looking at a fast twitch type to a fiber, they're all

467
00:41:54,102 --> 00:41:55,784
It's nothing crazy, right?

468
00:41:55,784 --> 00:41:58,507
They're all generating around the same amount of power.

469
00:41:58,507 --> 00:42:01,871
And then the slow type one fiber over here, everyone's

470
00:42:01,871 --> 00:42:04,395
kind of generating the same amount of fiber regardless if

471
00:42:04,395 --> 00:42:09,761
you're a distance runner versus untrained versus a competitive swimmer, right?

472
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:12,925
But let's look at this kind of Olympic athlete.

473
00:42:14,267 --> 00:42:22,877
What was surprising here is the amount of power that this individual muscle fiber was generating.

474
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:25,263
was quite high.

475
00:42:26,285 --> 00:42:31,597
And so this started to question this notion that we all have

476
00:42:31,597 --> 00:42:37,623
the exact same type of type 1, type 2 fiber.

477
00:42:37,623 --> 00:42:43,451
Now, this is one person that doesn't necessarily mean, OK, now we have to change our thought.

478
00:42:43,451 --> 00:42:50,000
We would theoretically have to get a larger sample size to be able to kind of parse this out.

479
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,407
But this kind of questions this idea that, OK, everybody's

480
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:57,531
fiber is going to be generating the same amount of power.

481
00:42:59,874 --> 00:43:01,476
I would never test you on this.

482
00:43:01,476 --> 00:43:05,342
Please stay on the same track that we've been going on in class.

483
00:43:05,342 --> 00:43:06,904
But it's fun to see these things.

484
00:43:09,398 --> 00:43:10,320
Potentially, right?

485
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,709
And so this stirred a lot of debate, like, well, we need more data.

486
00:43:14,709 --> 00:43:19,839
Like, this just happened to be the reason why this sprinter was successful.

487
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,945
Let's check, because it's always like, well, did they train

488
00:43:22,945 --> 00:43:26,071
to this point, or were they born like this?

489
00:43:26,071 --> 00:43:28,755
And so that's why that debate will never go away until

490
00:43:28,755 --> 00:43:30,578
we can actually, we would never do this, right?

491
00:43:30,578 --> 00:43:33,804
Get a bunch of children and start like typing them

492
00:43:33,804 --> 00:43:36,448
and then pulling muscle fibers out and then follow them

493
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:40,094
through their career, like breed them into Olympians, right?

494
00:43:40,094 --> 00:43:41,837
Then we can do that.

495
00:43:41,837 --> 00:43:42,859
Someone else had a question up here?

496
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:44,641
No?

497
00:43:44,641 --> 00:43:46,064
Maybe I missed some.

498
00:43:46,064 --> 00:43:47,907
But yeah, this is pretty interesting, right?

499
00:43:47,907 --> 00:43:51,673
And it's hard to look at these things with just one

500
00:43:52,936 --> 00:44:00,428
individual, but this is pretty crazy as far as the

501
00:44:00,428 --> 00:44:05,576
amount of power that it was being generated from some of these individuals here.

502
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:12,167
But yeah, they did hold the world record, and so that could be something there.

503
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:12,748
Could be something.

504
00:44:15,432 --> 00:44:15,732
OK.

505
00:44:18,096 --> 00:44:19,939
This might be a good place to stop here.

506
00:44:21,556 --> 00:44:24,852
We'll talk about force regulation and muscle on Tuesday.

507
00:44:24,852 --> 00:44:25,435
Stay warm.

508
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,731
Have a great weekend.
